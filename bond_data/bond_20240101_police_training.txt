  Recruit and Officer Training Journey 

DPD Training – State Requirements 

State/TCOLE requires separation of  
Basic Peace Officer Course(BPOC)  
and post BPOC within classrooms.  

Basic:   

BPOC training – 60% 

Post BPOC – 40% 

In-Service 

Post BPOC –  100% of training 

The separation of recruits and  
officers aligns with standard best  
practices, current police academy  
facility layout, and operational  
procedures.

1.  Budget for 20-Acre site and buildings included in on Slide 8 except the Auditorium.  Costs in 2026 dollars and  
    based on programing level design.  Previous budget was $140M, in 2021 dollars, escalates to approximately  
    $180M in 2026 dollars.   

2.  Ballpark estimate for public safety complex based on available pricing for similar facilities with escalation to  
    2026 dollars. Based on research of five recent/similar projects, budgets range from $180M to $1.5B, with three  
    of the projects averaging  $330M. Once a site, consultant and programing are complete, this budget will be  
    confirmed.  In addition, Public Safety Complex will be designed to be a future source of revenue to offset the  
    cost of operations and maintenance.
