Phase 1 Project Plan 

                                      Benefits:  The updated plan for DPD Regional Training  
                                     Academy and Criminal Justice Center (CJC) at UNTD  
                                     provides 40% more square footage and state-of-the-art  
                                     amenities not available in the current facility.   

                                     This complex will be used to provide classroom instruction to  
                                     DPDs new recruits and will also be used to meet continuing- 
                                     education-requirements for existing and future DPD officers.   
                                     The planned facility can also accommodate training and  
                                     continuing education needs of other local, state and  
                                     federal  law enforcement agencies. 

                                     DPD’s training is recognized as the gold standard in the  
                                     North Texas region. This facility allows us to extend these  
                                     best practices to local agencies, enhancing training and  
                                     operational excellence across the region. 

                                                                                                            8
