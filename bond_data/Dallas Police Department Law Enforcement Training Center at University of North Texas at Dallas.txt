  Recruit and Officer Training Journey 

DPD Training – State Requirements 

State/TCOLE requires separation of  
Basic Peace Officer Course(BPOC)  
and post BPOC within classrooms.  

Basic:   

BPOC training – 60% 

Post BPOC – 40% 

In-Service 

Post BPOC –  100% of training 

The separation of recruits and  
officers aligns with standard best  
practices, current police academy  
facility layout, and operational  
procedures. 

                                                                                                                              5
