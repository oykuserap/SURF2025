       breakdown between all categories, resources  
       availability and capacity) 
    o  Contracts bundling and projects grouping 
    o  Operational efficiency and construction mobilization

         • Award design for all projects within the first 2 - 3 years and  
            allow remaining years for construction 
         •  Prioritize design of partnership and high-profile projects  
            through coordination with TRN Department 
         •  Prioritize construction projects currently undergoing design 
         •  Prioritize design of street petition projects

 2. Streets:

         •  Prioritize resurfacing projects as engineering design is not  
            required  
         • Schedule projects in the same neighborhood in the same  
            fiscal year

       years for construction 
    o  Prioritize design of alley petition projects

4. Sidewalks: 
    o  Cost-share program projects are addressed based on the order of  
       completed applications placed in line 
    o  Include senior citizen projects every fiscal year 
    o  Include equity projects every fiscal year
