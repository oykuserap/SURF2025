Technical Criteria 

What are Technical Criteria? 

•   set of measuring tools that City staff uses to rate project from a  
    technical standpoint 

•   allows staff to categorize and prioritize projects objectively 

•   projects in the needs inventory undergo a technical criteria  
    review by “infrastructure departments” 

•   needs inventory projects are compared within categories 

                                                                                       3

Technical Criteria for Economic Development 

 Criteria for project funding with Economic Development propositions  
 differ from typical needs inventory/technical criteria utilized by  
 “infrastructure departments” 

 •   projects are not necessarily known in advance 

 •   projects are not scored and compared based on point accumulation basis 

 •   availability of bond funding allows City to capitalize on moments of  
     opportunity as they arise 

 •   provides for flexibility of utilization in order to achieve City policy goals 

                                                                                               4
