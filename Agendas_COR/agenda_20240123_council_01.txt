October 23, 2023, Commission on Disabilities participated in the  
EmployAbility Resource Fair at the Kailey B. Hutchinson Convention  
Center.  Commissioners were on sight to provide information and  
resources to those in attendance. The purpose of the EmployAbility  
Resource fair was to provide information and tools regarding education,  
employment, and housing, which aligns with the strategic priorities of the  
Commission.    
  

Identified Needs   
Increased Awareness and Resources for People with Disabilities  
The Commission on Disabilities has and will continue to work with City of  
Dallas stakeholders to bring awareness and provide resources for issues  
often faced by people with disabilities. The Commission on Disabilities has  
identified three strategic priorities to focus on: Housing and Homeless  
Solutions, Employment, and Transportation/ Infrastructure. Through  
monthly meeting briefings the Commission, has found there is an  
abundance of tools and resources available for people with disabilities.   
The Commission on Disabilities is continuing to work to find ways to better  
share these resources with communities.     
  

Housing and Homeless Solutions  
The Commission on Disabilities is working to bring education to people with  
disabilities and provide pipeline programs with types of assistance and  
accommodations that will benefit the community. There are several  
solutions aimed at addressing housing for people with disabilities. These  
solutions include accessible housing designs, subsidies for housing  
modifications, supportive housing programs, community integration efforts,  
and increased access to affordable housing options.  Homeless solutions  
for people with disabilities often involve tailored support services, outreach  
programs, transitional housing programs, and collaborations between  
government, nonprofit, and communities to provide comprehensive  
assistance.

Employment and Equity  
Commission on Disabilities will continue to work on addressing inequities  
faced by non-working people with disabilities.  Some barriers to  
employment include, but are not limited to hiring discrimination,   
inaccessible workplaces. Promoting employment equity for people with  
disabilities involves implementing inclusive hiring practices, reasonable  
accommodations in the workplace, providing training and skill development,  
fostering accessible work environments, and advocating for equal  
opportunities. Companies and organizations can create diverse and  
inclusive workplaces by actively recruiting individuals with disabilities,  
ensuring accessible infrastructure and technology, offering support  
networks, and addressing biases or stereotypes. Government policies that  
incentivize inclusive hiring and support vocational training programs also  
play a significant role in fostering employment equity for people with  
disabilities.   

Transportation and Infrastructure  
The Commission on Disabilities has identified transportation  
accommodations that will better assist with people with disabilities.   
Improving transportation and infrastructure for people with disabilities  
involves creating accessible public transportation options, designing  
infrastructure with universal accessibility in mind, and ensuring that public  
spaces and facilities comply with disability regulations. This can include  
features like wheelchair ramps, elevators, accessible parking spaces,  
tactile paths for the visually impaired, audible signals at intersections, and  
designated spaces on public transport for wheelchair users. Additionally,  
investing in technologies and services such as paratransit services,  
accessible ride-sharing options, and innovative assistive devices can  
greatly enhance transportation options for individuals with disabilities.    

Recommendations for the City of Dallas  
Based on all the areas that have been discussed throughout 2023 the  
Commission on Disability recommends that the City of Dallas:  

    •   Explore local organizations and support groups catering to specific  
        disabilities for community and assistance resources.  Continue to  
        support communities with disabilities by improving communication for  
        events, providing resources to employment opportunities, and access
