              Staff Recommendation:  
              1.  That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness to  
                  construct an addition to the south side of the accessory  
                  (garage) structure  be denied without prejudice  with the  
                 finding that the proposed lot coverage would exceed the  
                  established  limit  of  35%  and  would  have  an  adverse  
                  effect  on  the  historic  district.    The  proposed  work,  
                 therefore,  is not consistent with City Code  Section  51A- 
                 4.501(g)(6)(C)(i)      for  contributing     structures    or   the  
                  Secretary of the Interior’s Standards.  
              2.  That the request for a  Certificate of Appropriateness to

                  denied   without   prejudice   with   the   finding   that   the  
                  proposed alteration would have an adverse effect on the  
                  historic   district   and   would   not    be   consistent   with  
                  preservation     criteria   Section    51P-87.111(a)(1);       the  
                  standards in City Code Section 51A-4.501(g)(6)(C)(i) for  
                  contributing structures; or the Secretary of the Interior’s  
                  Standards.  
              3.  That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness to  
                  remove  the  siding  on  the  accessory  building,  install  a  
                  chipboard sheeting, and then reinstall the #117 novelty  
                  siding, replacing in kind as necessary  be approved with  
                 the condition that any replacement siding exactly match  
                 the existing #117 novelty siding.  Implementation of the  
                  recommended condition would allow the proposed work  
                 to be consistent with preservation criteria Section 51P- 
                  87.111(a)(1);  the  standards  in  City  Code  Section  51A- 
                 4.501(g)(6)(C)(i)   for   contributing   structures;   and   the  
                  Secretary of the Interior’s Standards.  
              4.  That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness to  
                  repaint  the  accessory  structure  to  match  the  house  
                  [Lower four (4) feet: Behr UPW "Ultra-Pure White"; Upper  
                  portion: Behr M140-7 "Dark Crimson") be approved.  The  
                  proposed  work  is  consistent  with  preservation  criteria  
                  Section  51P-87.111(a)(1);  the  standards  in  City  Code  
                  Section 51A-4.501(g)(6)(C)(i) for contributing structures;
