Service  Requests  

  
• Since council vote on 06/14/23  
    there have been 160 calls for  
    service for STR related complaints  
• The most common complaints are  
    noise, general ongoing operation,  
    parking complaints, and litter.  
•  CCS dispatches staff to reported  
    problem properties, engaging and  
    educating  property owners  
    regarding regulations;  
    Issuing notices of violation for any  
    apparent violations within CCS  
    authority.

STR  Registrations  

  •  Due to legal injunction, the enforcement of  
         the  short-term rental ordinances has been  
         suspended.  
  •  As a result, no properties have been legally  
         registered to operate by Code Compliance.

    Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT)  

  
•   Per Chapter 351 of the Texas Tax Code and Chapter 334 of the Texas Local Government Code, every  
     person  (entity) owning, operating, managing, or controlling a short-term rental (STR) in the City of Dallas  
     (City) is required to collect Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT) in the amount of 9% of net room receipts from  
     their guests and report the collections and pay the HOT to the City. Guests who stay 30 or more  
     consecutive nights are exempt from paying HOT.  

•   HOT collected from STRs for the periods of June 2023 through July 2024: $3,907,558.75  

•   HOT collected from STRs during FY 2023: $3,824,201.93  

•   HOT collected from STRs during FY 2024 YTD July: $2,650,731.47  

                                  STR Counts  
  
                                         7/3/2023            9/3/2024

•   Key Challenges in Collection: The City Controller’s Office (CCO) mails monthly notifications to  
     properties identified as potential STRs. The challenge is that not all property owners/managers respond  
     to the CCO’s request to register their property to file and pay HOT.

Ongoing Initiatives  

  
• CCS staff continues enforcement of its existing  
    ordinances governing minimum property standards,  
    disturbing noises, and private nuisances while  
     providing education to operators upon encounter  
    and via our dedicated STR webpage.  
• CCS staff has maintained a relationship with our

        Memorandum  
  
  
  
   DATE  September  13, 2024                                                                     CITY OF DALLAS  

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee  

SUBJECT  City Facilities Partners Update – Dallas Theater Center  
  
        The City of Dallas Office of Arts and Culture typically contracts with various Dallas-based  
        arts  and  culture  non-profit  organizations  for  two  purposes.  The  most  common  is  
        contracting  for  artistic  and  cultural  services  for  Dallas  residents  and  visitors.  More  
        uniquely, Dallas contracts with select organizations to provide long-term management of  
        City-owned cultural venues. The Office of Arts and Culture (OAC) will provide a series of  
        monthly  memoranda  as  an  update  on  each  of  our  facility  management  partners  in  
        alignment with the Dallas Cultural Plan 2018 initiative to, “increase transparency in facility  
        policies and structures.”  
  
        Historical Context  
  
        The Office of Arts and Culture has a history of contracts with Dallas Theater Center (DTC)  
        under both purposes referenced above. On an annual basis, OAC contracts with DTC  
        through the Cultural Organizations  Program (COP) which provides operating support for  
        Dallas-based arts and culture non-profit organizations for a year-long season of artistic  
        and cultural services and/or events. City Council annually approves both the guidelines  
        for COP and the eventual funding allocation to recommended organizations. In FY 2023-  
        24, DTC was awarded $90,007 through a COP contract which will end September  30,  
        2024. OAC is currently in the funding recommendation process for FY 2024-25. The COP  
        funding allocation is currently scheduled to be briefed to QOLAC on October 21, 2024  
        and considered for approval by City Council on October 23, 2024.  
  
        The City also holds a long-term facility management agreement with DTC to manage the  
        operations of Kalita Humphrey’s Theater and the Heldt Annex adjacent to the Kalita. The  
        initial management agreement was executed in 1973, when DTC donated the Kalita to  
        the City of Dallas with the general agreement for DTC to operate the building and the City  
        to provide maintenance and repair. The City charges DTC $1 annually to lease the Kalita  
        for operation. Since the initial agreement, the City has executed five (5) amendments to  
        the contract. Below is a timeline with brief details related to each of the five amendments  
        as well as key events and actions related to the Kalita and DTC’s operation of the venue:  
  
        1959  
            •    DTC built Kalita Humphreys Theater designed by renowned architect Frank Lloyd  
                 Wright, with an education wing added in1968.  
        1973  
            •    DTC donates the Kalita Humphrey’s Theatre to the City of Dallas and the initial  
                 lease agreement is executed with term ending 1993 establishing DTC to operate  
                 the building and the City to provide maintenance.

                    for the Kalita by the end of 2020. The amendment also updated DTC’s operating  
                    model to include an Equitable Access Plan reflecting Dallas Cultural Plan’s priority  
                    of Equity and Space and right to sublease. The three-year  Equitable Access Plan  
                    began FY 23 and ends in FY 25, including anchor tenants Uptown Players (Kalita)  
                    and Second Thought Theater (Heldt Annex Building). Additional language for DTC  
                    to maintain the Kalita in a clean, safe, condition and in good order and repair during  
                    its use of the premises. The amendment also extended the lease agreement term  
                    to June 1, 2024.

                    for non-resident rentals by one year.  
  
  
           Current Status and Needs  
  
           The Kalita Humphrey’s Theater is an important cultural asset with critical investments  
           needs  and  repairs.  The  2024  Bond  Program  includes  $8,983,794  for  upgrades  and  
           repairs to HVAC systems, fire alarm upgrades, public safety upgrades, elevator upgrades,

           including backstage area repairs and upgrades. Bond projects scheduled for year two of  
           five in bond project executions. However, critical investment needs and repairs  may go  
           beyond the cost and scope of the 2024 bond funding.

             The  most  pressing  item  under  consideration  is  how  OAC  will  address  the  upcoming  
             expiration of the most recent contract amendment with DTC which terminates the long-  
             term management agreement on June 1, 2025. It is the intention of OAC to continue  
             conversations with DTC leadership and other key stakeholders through the rest of the  
             2024 calendar year to establish an administrative timeline for options related to the lease  
             agreement,   community   and   stakeholder  engagement,  effective   models  for   facility  
              maintenance and repair, and updates to QOLAC and City Council. OAC leadership has  
             already been in conversations with DTC and core tenant, Uptown Players, to discuss  
              upcoming lease agreement expiration and timelines as well as gathering feedback on the  
              Equitable Access Plan to inform future discussions and recommendation on how OAC  
              may proceed and further inform QOLAC.

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee  

        Upcoming Office of Community Care Agenda Item to Authorize an Amendment  
SUBJECT  to the Service Contract with Senior Citizens of Greater Dallas for the Senior  
        Services Ombudsman Program  
  
        On September 25, 2024, the following Office of Community Care item will be considered  
        by City Council:  
  
        File ID: 24-2432: Authorize an amendment to the service contract with Senior Citizens of  
        Greater  Dallas,  Inc.  to  provide  nursing  home  ombudsman  services,  which  includes  
        receiving,  investigating  and  resolving  complaints  and  assisting  in  obtaining  goods  or  
        services for seniors residing in nursing homes and assisted living facilities within the City  
        of  Dallas  -  Not  to  exceed  $50,868.00,  from  $250,868.00  to $301,736.00 –  Financing:  
        General Funds  
  
        Background  
        The City of Dallas has a longstanding partnership with Senior Citizens of Greater Dallas,  
        Inc. (“Senior Source”), to serve older adults in our community, including support for a key  
        initiative, the Senior Services Ombudsman Program. City funds have long supported this  
        project to promote safety in Dallas assisted living and nursing home facilities, bolstering  
        local capacity of staff and volunteers to make proactive and responsive visits to these  
        facilities, and to conduct outreach and engagement with older adults residing in these  
        facilities, and their families. The goal of the program is to assist residents and to protect  
        their health, safety, welfare and rights. This is accomplished through advocacy efforts of  
        volunteer  and  paid  certified  ombudsmen  who  respond  to  long-term  care  residents’  
        requests for assistance with complaints and concerns. Nursing home and assisted living  
        monitoring by certified ombudsmen include observation, research, and investigation of  
        concerns.  The  Ombudsman  Program  is  also  a  resource  for  residents  and  families  
        searching for a long-term care facility. The program provides training to nursing home and  
        assisted living staff, as well as resident and family councils, on residents’ rights, the role  
        of the ombudsman, abuse and neglect, and reducing restraint use.  
  
        About this Amendment  
        This  amendment  corrects  a  prior  error  in  the  contract  renewal  for  Senior  Source,  by  
        correcting the funding level to be consistent with the annual budget set forth in the three-  
        year agreement (one-year plus two one-year renewal options). The error took place when  
        the  initial  contract  authorization  language  did  not  properly  authorize  the  renewals,  
        creating inconsistency. The first renewal was scheduled for November 2023, and it was  
        at this time that the error was discovered, forcing the department to execute the renewal  
        via administrative action due to time limitations creating a risk of service lapse. However,  

                                                             “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                      Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                47

           this  only enabled  the authorization  of a  portion  of  the  second-year  funding.  This  item  
           corrects that error by correcting the funding level.  
  
           Funding for this item will enable the Senior Source to continue service delivery through  
           the end of the second year of this contract period, at which point the department will return  
           to this committee and properly authorize the third renewal option, and provide assistance  
           to 1,000 seniors. Funding supports staff, both those who make the visits and those who  
           recruit and train volunteers, as well as training costs. The staff and volunteers enabled by  
           City support allow for numerous additional visits, where staff and volunteers observe the  
           facilities, living conditions and treatment of residents first-hand, and are able to interact  
           with residents, receive complaints or concerns related to resident safety or other issues,  
           and through the Senior Source’s designation as ombudsman, are able to respond to and  
           address complaints. Examples of the types of complaints received include lack of staff  
           assistance,  resident  neglect  (eg  bed  sores),  special  dietary  needs  not  being  met,  
           discharges and evictions, and other critical issues.

   DATE  September  13, 2024                                                                              CITY OF DALLAS  
  
     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee  
  
SUBJECT  Proposed Elimination of the Hotspot and Laptop Loaning Program  
  
         The  purpose  of  this  memo  is  to  provide  background  information  on  the  proposed  
         elimination of the hotspot laptop lending program in the City Manager’s Recommended  
         Biennial Budget for FY 2024-25 and FY 2025-26. After careful consideration of the factors  
         below, this cost reduction measure helps the Dallas Public Library to maintain its current  
         level  of  service  across  the  City  and  expanded  hours  across  the  system  which  were  
         instituted in January 2024.  

  
         This program was selected based on several factors:  
  
              •    Initial investment in wifi hotspot laptops was largely a response to the COVID-19  
                   pandemic  to  promote internet access during  a  period  in  which  library  buildings  
                  were closed.  
              •   While hotspot laptops do provide a temporary connection to the internet, 30-day  
                   loans of hotspot laptops are not a long-term solution for home internet service that  
                  would support remote work and/or online learning.  
              •   The program cost is high compared to other services. For 1,800 hotspots, the total  
                  cost  of  the  program  is  $619,920.  This  is  higher  than  other  proposed  cuts  to  
                   programming staff and entire branch staffing.  
              •   Compared to other loanable materials the staff time required is intensive. More  
                  than any other type of material, these items are lost or returned with incomplete  
                   parts causing conflicts with the public for Library personnel.  
              •    Ending the hotspot laptop program preserves in Library service where access to  
                  the internet can be accompanied by Library personnel that can assist with digital  
                   literacy skills.  
  
         Should you have any questions or need any additional information, please contact myself  
         or Mary Jo Giudice, Director of Library, at 214-670-7803 or maryjo.giudice@dallas.gov  
  
         Sincerely,  

                                                                 “Service First, Now!”
