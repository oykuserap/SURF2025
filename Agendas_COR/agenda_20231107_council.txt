             Memorandum Item 3A 

DATE         November 7, 2023                                                                   CITY OF DALLAS 

TO:          Members ofthe Community Police Oversight Board 

SUBJECT: Dynell Lane Independent Investigation by OCPO 

         Part A: Background 
         Mr. Lane filed a complaint with DPD on June 3, 2023. After reviewing the case IAD determined 
         that the case would be classified as a "No Investigation" because they "were unable to establish a 
         violation ofdepartmental policies or procedures." 

         After receiving the results ofthe investigation from DPD's Internal Affairs Division (IAD), Mr. 
         Lane filed an appeal with the CPOB. At the August 8, 2023, CPOB meeting, the Board reviewed 
         the complaint ofMr. Dynell Lane and voted for OCPO to do an independent investigation into the 
         case. 

         OCPO was in the process ofbeginning their investigation when it received an email from Major 
         Irene Alanis who is the commanding officer in charge ofIAD stating, "Be advised, I have opened 
         an investigation on Mr. Lanes EC2023-0603 complaint." 

         Part B:  Status ofthe OCPO Independent Investigation & Next Steps 
         Based on that notification from IAD, former OCPO Director McClary instructed OCPO Special 
         Investigator Williams to halt his investigation until OCPO receives the findings from IAD. 

        At the September 12 CPOB meeting Major Alanis informed the Board that IAD was actively 
         conducting the investigation.  She stated that her desire was that the investigation be concluded as 
         soon as possible. To help expedite the conclusion ofthe investigation, she has limited the caseload 
         ofthe detective handling the Lane investigation.  That detective will only work on the Lane case 
        until the investigation is concluded. 

         OCPO is actively monitoring the IAD investigation ofMr. Lane's complaint which is currently in 
         draft status, and has been reviewed by OCPO.
