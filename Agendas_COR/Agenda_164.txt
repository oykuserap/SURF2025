        FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee in engaging stakeholders across  North Texas to  
        prioritize human rights opportunities as part of the region’s legacy in hosting the 2026  
        World  Cup,  for  the  first  part  of  the  workshop.  The  second  part  of  the  Human  Rights  
        Workshop  specifically focused  on  the  City's  role,  where  OEI  led  efforts  to  engage  84  
        stakeholders  in understanding the human rights issues faced by residents in their daily  
        lives and when interacting with City services. This memo will focus on the second part of  
        the Human Rights Workshop pertaining specifically to the City of Dallas.  

        The Workforce, Education, and Equity Committee provided the impetus to hosting the  
        Human Rights Workshop during OEI’s presentation during the June 10, 2024, meeting  
        when WEE called on the office to leverage a workshop to identify relevant issues and  
        strategies whose implementation would be supported by a community-based task force.  

        Designing the Human Rights Workshop  
        Key focus areas leading up to hosting the Workshop included:  
  
           I.    Research Brief on Human Rights Issues: The office first took stock of recently  
                 publicly reported human rights issues identified by the consultant across 7 human  
                 rights  areas  to  inform  the  issues  stakeholders  would  be  engaged  on  before  
                 developing mitigating strategies. Based on the research brief and in alignment with  
                 WEE   priority   areas,   the   7   areas   included:   1)   Safeguarding  and   Inclusion  
                 (Vulnerable Populations), 2) Housing and Homelessness, 3) Re-Entry, 4) Worker’s  
                 Rights, 5) Migrants, 6) Veterans, and 7) Safety and Security/ Policing  
          II.    Landscape  Assessment  by  City  Colleagues: To avoid duplication of existing  
                 City strategies and to inform a successful engagement, we reached out to City of  
                 Dallas  contacts  whose  work  overlapped  with  these  7  human  rights  areas.  
                 Information  collected  focused  on  a  high-level  overview  of  existing  programs,  
                 services,  and  activities  and  identification  of  any  issues  beyond  those  already  
                 identified. OEI also leveraged this engagement to build out an external stakeholder  
                 list sourced from City colleagues.  

                                                             “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                      Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                59

             III.    Axes Activity with Subject-Matter Expert Facilitators: Based on the 7 human  
                     rights areas identified, OEI recruited 5 City colleagues, 1 Commissioner from  
                     the Veteran Affair’s Commission, 2 non-profit  partners, and 1 law enforcement  
                     professional to lead or co-lead an axes exercise the day of the Workshop whose  
                     scales  included  Minimal  Risk  to  Significant  Risk  and  then  Limited  Impact  to  
                     Significant  Impact.  The  facilitator’s  goal  was  to  help  drive  consensus  where  a  
                     particular issue should be placed in light of its priority.  
             IV.     Pre-Activity:  Invited stakeholders were given the opportunity to prioritize human  
                     rights issues and submit additional issues for consideration using a pre-activity.  

  
            Hosting the Human Rights Workshop  
            OEI held the Human Rights Workshop on October 31, 2024, at Fair Park. Following the  
            morning World Cup session, where Interim City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert and  
            Assistant City Manager Liz Cedillo-Pereira spoke, Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam  
            Bazaldua spoke to set the stage for the City of Dallas session with highlights including:  
  
                •    Stakeholders: 84 stakeholders registered to attend from a wide spectrum of  
                     local government, non-profit, business, and civil society organizations.  
                •    Human Rights Topics: Based on a wide research survey of identified human  
                     rights issues, stakeholders prioritized 42 topics across the full 7 areas.  
                     Stakeholders were given the opportunity to submit and prioritize additional topics,  
                     and an additional 46 topics were discussed and prioritized (88 total topics).  

                                                                 “Service First, Now!”

SUBJECT  Response to Questions from WEE Briefing Regarding Early Childhood and Out  
         of School Time Programs  
  
         This  memo  provides  information  on  an  upcoming  Office  of  Community  Care  and  
         Empowerment agenda item, and a response to questions posed by Committee members  
         during  a  November  2024  briefing.  On  December  11,  2024,  the  following  Office  of  
         Community Care and Empowerment item will be considered by City Council:  
  
         Item #50: Authorize (1) the implementation of the Drivers of Poverty Program (Childcare)  
         that  targets  residents  of  the  City  of  Dallas  who  are  low-to-moderate  income  needing  
         childcare  assistance  and meets  two of  the nine  Drivers  of Poverty,  as  outlined  in  the  
         Mayor’s  Taskforce  on  Poverty,  approved  in  the  City’s  FY2024-FY2029  Five-Year  
         Consolidated  Plan  Budget,  and  as  described  in  Exhibit  A;  and  (2)  the  execution  of  
         contracts with fully-licensed childcare providers selected by eligible parents (that meet  
         the eligibility criteria outlined in Exhibit A), and any and all documents required by the  
         contract and to provide subsidy payments to these fully-licensed childcare providers; for  
         the period of January  1, 2025 through September 30, 2025 - Not to exceed $618,565.00  
         - Financing: 2024-25 Community Development Block Grant Fund  
  
         Background  
         This Agenda Item authorizes a Program Statement for the Drivers of Poverty – Childcare  
         Program, to be funded using FY25 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Public  
         Services funding.  
  
         On June 12, 2024, City Council authorized the five-year Housing and Urban Development  
         (HUD)  Consolidated  Plan,  inclusive  of  a  Drivers  of  Poverty  program.  The  Community  
         Development Committee recommended this priority for Council adoption, and in doing so  
         also included “Childcare” in the Drivers of Poverty programming.  
  
         On June  12, 2024, City Council adopted the annual Consolidated Plan budget for FY25,  
         including $1,388,301 ($738,301 PKR Out-of-School Time Program + $650,000 OCCE  
         ECOSTS Program) for childcare,  and  an additional  $618,565 for Drivers  of Poverty  –  
         Childcare program. In order to advance this Drivers of Poverty – Childcare program, staff  
         developed the  recommended  program  statement  to  prioritize  use  of  funding  from  this  
         portion of the budget on clients that meet certain Drivers of Poverty criteria, including (1)  
         high poverty rates for single female headed households and (2) neighborhoods of highly  
         concentrated poverty.  

                                                                   “Service First, Now!”

            Upcoming Office of Community Care and Empowerment Agenda Item  
SUBJECT     and Response to Questions from WEE Briefing Regarding Early  
            Childhood and Out of School Time Programs  
   PAGE     Page 2 of 6  

  
           In support of this focus, data shows that Dallas has some of the highest poverty rates in  
           the  United  States,  with  48%  of  single  mothers  living  in  poverty.  These  families  face  
           generational cycles of poverty, leading to more children living in poverty. Programs that  
           focus on family support, such as childcare programming and those that provide financial  
           and   employment   assistance,   can   be   critical   for   these   households.   Additionally,  
           neighborhoods with high concentrations of poverty refers to a geographic area where  
           significantly  large portion  of  residents  live  below  the  federal  poverty  line.  Specifically,  
           these are defined by the U.S. Census as areas where 40% of the census tract population  
           lives  below  the  federal poverty  threshold.  The  City  of  Dallas’  poverty  rate  is currently  
           17.5%. This year’s Drivers of Poverty programming will target the City’s top 20 zip codes  
           of highest poverty rates.  
  
           Follow Up to WEE Briefing  
           On November 5, 2024, Office of Community Care and Empowerment staff, alongside of  
           staff from Dallas Afterschool, a local nonprofit organization focused on strengthening the  
           local out of school time landscape and supporting providers, briefed the WEE Committee  
           on  the  landscape  and  City  programs  for  early  childhood  care  and  out  of  school  time  
           services, collectively referred to as Early Childhood and Out of School Time or ECOST  
           programming. Several questions were posed by members during the meeting and this  
           portion of the memo serves to provide a response to these questions.  

                1)  What are the budgets for these organizations [those that received grants through  
                    the City’s ECOST Provider Support program administered by Dallas Afterschool]  
                    that impact kids?  
                        a.  The  annual budget  for  Out  of  School  Time  (OST)  grantees  ranges  from  
                             roughly $400,000.00 to $4,000,000.00. Based on a sample requested from  
                             Educational  First  Steps  (EFS),  a  partner  of  Dallas  Afterschool,  who  
                             implemented  the  City’s  ARPA  ECOSTS  program,  the  annual  budget  for  
                             early childhood care providers for 10 centers within their service area, the  
                             average monthly center budget ranges from $12,000- $95,000, which is an  
                             average  of  $49,500  monthly.  This  makes  the  annual  budget  range  from  
                             $144,000- $1,1140,000, with an annual average budget of $594,000. This  
                             is comparison data for annual budgets that operate childcare centers who  
                             serve similar children and families.  
  
               2)  What  are  the  costs  associated  with  early  childhood  and  afterschool  programs,  
                    particularly, in different locations?  
                        a.   Dallas Afterschool partners with OST programs that are free or low-cost for  
                             students. Tuition at these programs ranges from $0 per week up to $65 per  
                             week. Based on the national average, tuition for early childhood programs  
                             is  $11,582  per  child,  annually.  However,  the  costs  associated  with  ECE  
                             programs  depend  on  the  age  of  the  child.  i.e.,  infants,  toddlers,  and

                             more  expensive.  In  addition,  childcare  programs  vary  depending  on  
                             location, with childcare centers located in the northern sector typically more  
                             expensive than those in the southern sector.  
  
                3)  How long will the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) money last, and what is the  
                    impact of these programs when it goes away?  
                        a.  The  subrecipient  agreement  between  the  City  and  Dallas  Afterschool  to  
                             administer  support  services  and  grants  to  community  based  ECOSTS  
                             providers is in place through May 2025. It is anticipated that all funding will  
                             be distributed by then. Like Dallas Afterschool, most OST partner providers  
                             rely on grants and donations to exist. When the ARPA funding is no longer  
                             available, organizations must find ways to make up the funding.  

                4)  How many families are impacted by both [early childhood and out of school time]  
                    programs and how does that fit into the overall need?  
                        a.  The 12 OST grantees serve roughly 75 students each, which translates to  
                             900 students and families that have benefited from the ARPA funding (we  
                             do not track sibling participation). EFS serves 135 Home-based Care and  
                             Childcare centers in 6 counties. Specifically in Dallas proper, there are 28  
                             centers as partners with 2,654 seats. The recipients of the OST grant are  
                             43% of EFS centers and 34% of EFS students are receiving the benefits of  
                             OST within Dallas proper. For  Dallas County as a whole, EFS partners are  
                             in  42  centers,  serving  a  total  of  3,963  students,  which  means  the  OST  
                             grantees make up only 29% of EFS centers and 23% of the students that  
                             EFS  serves.  Other  families  impacted  include  the  staff  at  the  programs  
                             themselves, many of whom were able to retain  their jobs due to the extra  
                             funding.  
  
           Nonprofit Children at Risk published a Child Care Deserts Map, an interactive tool for  
           viewing childcare availability statewide. This tool visualized the ratio available childcare  
           slots for children ages 0-5 with the number of children of working parents. It can be viewed

                           a.  There are roughly 100,000 kids in Dallas who would enroll in an afterschool  
                                program if one were available. Dallas Afterschool partnered with the Child  
                                Poverty Action Lab (CPAL) to create an Afterschool Landscape Map, which

                               Drivers of Poverty Program (Childcare)  
                                             Program Statement  

  
Introduction – Statistical Data:  
  
The Texas Legislative Study Group posted on August 13, 2024, the following statical data  
regarding the need for affordable childcare for working families in Texas.  
  
“Child care programs provide children safe, nurturing environments to learn and grow,  
enabling parents to work to support their families and the state’s economy.  
Recent reports show Texas is home to about 2.3 million children under six, with 68%  
having two parents working.”  
“ The shortage of affordable child care is not just a family issue, it’s a statewide economic  
problem.  Working parents who struggle to find quality, affordable care may arrive late,  
leave  early,  miss  promotions,  delay  professional  development,  or  even  leave  the  
workforce altogether. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation report estimated that  
Texas loses $9.39 billion annually from its economy due to insufficient childcare.”  
  
“For  many  working  parents,  the  critical  need  for  child  care  comes  with  a  significant  
financial burden.  Approximately 85% of the child care industry is privately funded, with  
some federal support available for eligible families.  On average, American families with  
a child under five spends about $10,000 annually on child  care, which is about 13% of  
their income. In Texas, the average annual cost of infant care is $9,324, which is higher  
than the average in-state college tuition, according to the latest data from the Economy  
Policy Institute.  The financial strain is a stark reality for many families, making quality  
child care a luxury rather than a necessity.”  
  
In conclusion, “Childcare is essential for economic productivity and child development,  
but the current system fails to meet the needs of families and provides.  Public funding  
and policy changes are crucial to addressing these issues to create a more sustainable  
childcare system that benefits children, families, and the state.”  
  
  
Program Description – Drivers of Poverty Program (Childcare)  
The  Drivers  of  Poverty  Program  as  approved  in  the  City’s  FY2024-2029  Five-Year  
Consolidated Plan Budget, under childcare targets residents of the City of Dallas who are  
low income needing childcare assistance and meet two of the nine Drivers of Poverty, as  
outlined in the Mayor’s Taskforce on Poverty.  
  
Nine Drivers of Poverty:  
1. Sharp decline in median income and the declining share of middle-income  
    households/Increasing Numbers of “Have” and “Have-Nots” Neighborhoods;  
2. Lack of affordable transportation;  
3. Lack of Home Ownership/High Rental Percentage/Single Family Rentals;  

                                                                                                           10-1-2024  
  

                                                                                                                                 69  

----------------------- Page 73-----------------------

4. Neighborhoods of Concentrated Poverty (which are increasing);  
5. High Number of Households with Children Living in Poverty;  
6. Lack of educational attainment;  
7. High percentage of limited English-proficiency residents;  
8. High teen birth rates; and  
9. High Poverty Rates for Single Women Heads of Households with Children.  
  
Two Drivers Chosen for the Childcare Program:  
     •   High Poverty Rates for Single Women Heads of Households with Children  
     •   Neighborhoods of Concentrated Poverty  
  
Census Data:  
According  to  the  2022  U.S.  Census Bureau,  5-year-estimate  census  tables.  The total  
Female Head of Households in the City of Dallas is 84,657. The following 20 zip codes  
listed in the chart below, represent the top neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and  
will be the targeted for this program. The chart also shows the number of children living  
in those zip codes, by age groups.

This program will provide subsidy payments to childcare providers chosen by the eligible  
parents for childcare assistance. The above two Drivers of Poverty were chosen based  
on community feedback and the need to bridge disparities among the most vulnerable  
residents and advancing equity.  The goal  is to reducing/eliminating barriers to work and  
provide access to affordable childcare.

         Contract Status Update on the Benefits Navigation Project with Benefits Data  
SUBJECT  

         Trust  
  
         This  memo  provides  an  update  on  the  Benefits  Navigation  project  partnership  with  
         Benefits Data Trust.  
  
         On April 12, 2023, City Council authorized a one-year service contract with a one-year  
         renewal with Benefits Data Trust to develop and design a benefits navigation program  
         implementation plan. The project was established to be administered in 2 phases, with  
         Phase 1 focused on research, landscape analysis, and partner engagement.  
  
         Background  
  
         On September 6, 2024, the City issued a Termination Letter to Benefits Data Trust related  
         to the benefits navigation contract. This Termination Letter was issued in response to a  
         notification from the organization of their planned closure. While initially advised of this  
         closure in late June, the organization had spent time exploring potential mergers and  
         other solutions to avoid closure. In the meantime, OCCE staff worked to ensure that all  
         deliverables and materials were received.  
  
         The timing of the closure roughly aligns with the end of Phase 1 of programming. In order  
         to properly close the project, staff met with the organization several times, as well as with  
         various  subcontractors  that  completed  various  project  components.  Staff  collected  all  
         required reports and supporting data, as well as other critical information to ensure that  
         the information learned through the project would be accessible and usable to the City for  
         future program design.  
  
         This  work  was  completed  in  collaboration  with  Child  Poverty  Action  Lab,  along  with  
         consultants  and  contractors  including  Steady  State  Impact  Strategies,  Third  Horizon  
         Strategies, and Advocatia Solutions. A summary report of the work demonstrates that an  
         estimated $410M in public benefits were left unclaimed annually in Dallas. Insight from  
         participant  interviews  shows  inconsistent  experiences  across  different  programs,  with  
         WIC being considered relatively easy to access compared with SNAP and Medicaid. Lack  
         of communication and clarity realted to application status, rules and denials, combined  
         with long wait times and household barriers, like transportation, documentation difficulties  
         and difficulty finding employment in alingment with SNAP workforce requirements, also  
         contribute to difficulties in access benefits for clients. The report further recommends in  
         person assistance from trusted sources, utilization of AI to speed up document review,  
         and clarity around rules and program requirements.  

                                                                  “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                           Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                       74

             Contract Status Update on the Benefits Navigation Project with  
SUBJECT  
             Benefits Data Trust  
  
   PAGE      2 of 3  
             

             
            A gap analysis report showed varied support in benefits access for residents in need,  
             highlighting available navigation for health and nutrition benefits, insufficient support for  
             utility benefits and scarce support for other benefits. The report summarizes the local  
             benefits access landscape as reactive rather than proactive, with insufficient follow up  
            and a lack of streamlined services. The report also notes the current state of service is  
             mostly  in  person  application  support,  with  few  organizations  offering  troubleshooting  
            services and staffing limitations across organizations leading to incomplete assistance.  
             
            Additionally,  a  report  of  insights  gleaned  from  health  care  organizations  highlights  
            significant health and well-being challenges for Dallas residents, particularly lower income  
             residents. The report highlights that screening and some resource navigation tends to be  
            available  in  healthcare  settings,  but  is  incomplete,  and  recommends  centralized  (or  
            virtually federated) resources to better connect residents with public benefits.  

            The below is a summary of the deliverables received.  

             Phase 1 Deliverables: (All Completed)  
                  1.        Updated benefits crosswalk  
                 2.         Benefits Access Gap Analysis  
                 3.         Report        that      summarizes            its     research         and       provides         preliminary  
                            recommendations  on  key  partners  with  whom  to  engage  on  pilots/proofs  of  
                           concepts, prioritized populations, pilot design concepts, and metrics to track  
                            impact  
             
             Phase 1 Performance Measures: (Met or exceeded)  
                  1.       20 potential partners identified (exceeded goal of  10)  
                 2.        52 interviews held (exceeded goal of 40)  
                           a.         BDT Client Interview Report  
                 3.        2 user experience workshops held (Met goal of 2)  
             
            Additional Deliverable (Phase 2 Deliverable completed early during Phase 1)  
                  1.   1 pilot program partially completed serving 156 Dallas ISD students served through  
                      telephonic-benefits navigation and application support pilot – this was to be part of  
                      4 pilots planned for Phase 2 that would have collectively informed the final  
             
             
             Follow Up  
            Since the termination of the agreement, staff has had conversations with several entities  
            engaged  or  interested  in  the  work.  Additionally,  OCCE  staff  is  coordinating  with  City  
             Manager’s Office and Budget Management Services (BMS) to develop recommendations  
            for reallocation of unspent funding tied to this contract as a part of a future briefing by  
             BMS.  

                                                                      “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                               Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                        75
