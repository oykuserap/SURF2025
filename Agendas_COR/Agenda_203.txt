Open Streets Pilot Program  

  
An Open Streets “event” would require a  
Special Event Permit through Chapter 42A.  
It would require:  
•  Public Safety Staffing  (42A- 13 and  14)  
•  Barricades/Traffic Control Devices  (42A-  
    16)  
•  Meter hooding and Parking Plan(42A- 17)  
•  Notifications (42A- 18)  
•  Portable restrooms and clean up plan  
    (42A- 19)  
•  City (CES-OSE, DPD, TPW) or city’s  
   designee would act as permit applicant  
   and would be responsible for required  
   elements.

Staff Recommendation  

  
Consider development of an Open Street pilot program as  
an additional public realm activation strategy. CES-OSE  
would work with DPD and TPW on proposed permit  
requirements based on pilot locations.

Next Steps  

  
•  Review Special Event Permit requirements and assess  
   minimum needs for activation  
• Work with city departments on minimum activation  
   requirements through Special Event Permit process  
• Work with local stakeholder organizations, merchant  
   associations, and neighborhood associations on possible  
   pilot program interest and draft schedule  
•  Bring findings back to the QoLAC Committee for final  
   recommendation

   DATE  November 8, 2024                                                                              CITY OF DALLAS

SUBJECT  City Facilities Partners Update – Sammons Center for the Arts  
  
        The City of Dallas Office of Arts and Culture typically contracts with various Dallas-based  
        arts  and  culture  non-profit  organizations  for  two  purposes.  The  most  common  is  
        contracting  for  artistic  and  cultural  services  for  Dallas  residents  and  visitors.  More  
         uniquely, Dallas contracts with select organizations to provide long-term management of  
         City-owned cultural venues. The Office of Arts and Culture (OAC) will provide a series of  
         monthly  memoranda  as  an  update  on  each  of  our  facility  management  partners  in  
        alignment with the Dallas Cultural Plan 2018 initiative to, “increase transparency in facility  
         policies and structures.”  
  
         Historical Context  
  
        The Office of Arts and Culture has a history of contracts with the Sammons Center of the  
        Arts  (Sammons)  under  both  purposes  referenced  above.  On  an  annual  basis,  OAC  
        contracts  with  Sammons  through  the  Cultural  Organizations  Program  (COP)  which  
         provides operating support for Dallas-based arts and culture non-profit organizations for  
        a year-long season of artistic and cultural services and/or events. City Council annually  
        approves   both   the   guidelines   for   COP   and   the   eventual   funding   allocation   to  
         recommended organizations.  In FY 2023-24, Sammons was awarded $121,170 through  
        a COP contract which ended September 30, 2024. OAC is currently in the contracting  
         process for FY 2024-25 after City Council approved an award for Sammons in the amount  
        of $121,170 on October 23, 2024  
  
        The  City  also  holds  a  long-term  facility  management  agreement  with  Sammons  to  
         manage the facility and operations of the Sammons Center for the Arts which is a fully  
         renovated cultural facility providing office space and administrative resources to various  
         Dallas-based arts and culture organizations as well as producing and hosting events in  
        their various rehearsal and performance spaces throughout the facility.  
  
        The initial management agreement was executed in 1981 to the Turtle Creek Center for  
        the Arts as an agreement to renovate the then abandoned Turtle Creek Pump Station to  
         be used for concerts, rehearsals, lectures, recitals, training, meetings, office space, and  
        other uses normal to the functions of similar arts and cultural organizations. After the  
         renovation and significant investment by Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Sammons, the facility  
        was  named  the  Sammons  Center  for  the  Arts.  Sammons  continues  its  operations  as  
        originally realized. As a part of the management agreement with the Sammons Center of  
        Arts,  the City allocates to Sammons $76,000 annually for facility operations and utility  
         reimbursement.

SUBJECT  

         88th Legislature  
  
         On August 22, 2024, the City Plan Commission recommended approval of an item (DCA  
        223-008)  to  amend  Chapter  51A,  the  Dallas  Development  Code,  to  comply  with  the  
         requirements of Texas Senate Bill 929 (SB 929), 88th  Legislature. Below is an outline of  

        this memorandum.  

         I.  Background  
                  A.  What did SB 929 say?  
                  B.  What is a nonconforming use?  
                  C.  How  are  nonconforming  use  rights  lost  without  an  established  compliance  
                       date?  
         II.   Impacts and Proposal

                  D.  What was discussed at public hearings?  
  
         BACKGROUND  
  
        What did SB 929 say?  
  
         On May 19, 2023, Texas Senate Bill (SB) 929 was signed and went into effect. The bill  
         Impacts the Dallas Development Code and requires amendments in two significant areas.  

         1.  The bill requires a city to add a statement when providing written notice of any public  
             hearing  regarding  a  proposed  zoning  change  that  could  result  in  the  creation  of a  
             nonconforming use. This statement must be sent by mail to each property owner and  
             occupant and contain the following bold 14-point type font language:  

                  THE  CITY  OF  DALLAS  IS  HOLDING  A  HEARING  THAT  WILL  
                  DETERMINE                WHETHER               YOU        MAY         LOSE         THE        RIGHT         TO  
                  CONTINUE  USING  YOUR  PROPERTY  FOR  ITS  CURRENT  USE.  
                  PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.

   PAGE     2 of 5  

  
           2.  The bill also preempts the current board of adjustment (“board”) hearing process for  
                setting a compliance date for a nonconforming use and provides the owner a choice  
                of the following two remedies.  

                a.   Payment from the City for:  
  
                     i.   any  costs  directly  attributable  to  ceasing  the  nonconforming  use,  including  
                         expenses related to demolition, relocation, termination of a lease, or discharge  
                         of a mortgage; and  

                     ii.   an amount equal to the greater of, as determined by the City, the diminution in  
                         market value of the property, computed by subtracting the current market value  
                         of  the  property  after  a  requirement  to  cease  a  nonconforming  use  of  the  
                         property from the market value of the property on the day before:  

                              a.  the notice mentioned above is given; or  
  
                              b.   an application is submitted to the board of adjustment requesting that a  
                                  nonconforming use be required to cease operations; or  

                     b.  Amortize the investment in the nonconforming use through continued operation  
                         of the use until the investment is recovered  

           The nonconforming use must cease operations no later than 10 days after payment is  
            received  from  the  City  or  the  amount  of  the  payment  calculated  above  is  amortized  
           through continuing operation of the nonconforming use.  

           What is a nonconforming use?  
  
           A nonconforming use is a land use that was legal when it started but is now prohibited or  
            only allowed by a Specific Use Permit (SUP) due to changes in zoning regulations. This  
            occurs when the following conditions are met:  

                1.   Lawful Establishment: The land use must have been established in compliance  
                     with all applicable zoning regulations, building codes, and other relevant laws at  
                     the time it began operation. This requires obtaining necessary permits, licenses,  
                     and a certificate of occupancy.  

                2.  Zoning  Change:  A  subsequent  change  in  zoning  regulations  must  make  the  
                     existing land use non-compliant. This could involve a rezoning of the area or an  
                     amendment to the development code that prohibits or restricts the particular use.

             How are nonconforming use rights lost without an established compliance date?  
  
            Within  the  Dallas  Development  Code  and  except  for  establishing  a  compliance  date  
            through the board, there are three ways that a nonconforming use can lose the right to  
            continue operating.  

                                                                                      1

                 2.   If the original nonconforming use changes to a conforming use .  
  
                 3.   If the structure housing the use is destroyed by the intentional act of the owner or  
                      his agent. If the structure housing the nonconforming use is destroyed by a natural  
                      disaster or other act that was not intentional by  the owner or owner’s agent, the  
                      structure  housing  the  nonconforming  use  may  be  rebuilt  in  the  general  same  
                      location, size, and height as the one that was unintentionally destroyed without  

                                                                                                            3

             IMPACTS AND PROPOSAL  
  
            What is the impact of SB 929 on zoning notifications?  
  
            While not the primary focus of ZOAC or CPC meetings, the notification statement required  
             by  SB  929  will  significantly  heighten  business  owner  anxiety  whenever  a  use  could  
             become  nonconforming  due  to  a  code  amendment  or  zoning  change.  The  required  
            statement is also false and misleading because the hearing for a change in zoning cannot  
             determine whether a use may lose the right to continue to operate.  

            Three  recent  cases  have  highlighted  the  confusion  and  concerns  raised  by  SB  929  
             notifications at public hearings. Two City-authorized public hearings for the Elmwood and  
             Floral   Farms  areas  also   included   SB   929   notices  for   uses   that   would  become  
             nonconforming, primarily auto-service and industrial activities, respectively. Both cases  
             had multiple public meetings. Additionally, because the proposed Dallas Development  
             Code amendments for adult and child-care facilities contemplated a Specific Use Permit  
             (SUP) in industrial districts, many notified facilities opposed the amendment.

            AMENDMENT TO THE DALLAS DEVELOPMENT CODE TO ALIGN WITH TEXAS  
SUBJECT  
            SENATE BILL 929, 88TH LEGISLATURE  

   PAGE     4 of 5  

  
           The inclusion of SB 929's misleading all-caps, bold, 14-point font text further complicates  
           the    process       of   enacting      zoning     changes       and     code     amendments          to   advance  
            environmental   justice,   even   when   nonconforming   uses   may   continue   to   operate  
            indefinitely.  

           What is SB 929’s impact on establishing a compliance date for nonconforming uses?  
  
            SB 929 has significantly limited a municipality's ability to require nonconforming uses to  
            cease operations. If a City mandates that a nonconforming use cease operations by a  
            specific date, it is legally obligated to provide substantial compensation to the  business  
            owner. This compensation includes, as explained more fully above, the market value of  
           the business, the costs of shutting down or relocating, and any decrease in property value  
            resulting from the termination of the nonconforming use.  

            These  payouts   can  be  substantial  and  may  not  be  adequately  budgeted  for  by  
            municipalities. Even after receiving compensation, the property owner retains ownership  
            of the property and can continue to use it in any manner permitted by zoning regulations.  
           As  a  result,  SB  929  has  significantly  limited  a  municipality's  authority  to  terminate  
            nonconforming uses.  

           What is the likelihood that a nonconforming use will choose the payout option?  
  
            Staff anticipates that the payout option will primarily be chosen if the board determines a  
            nonconforming  use  must  come  into  compliance.  This  expectation  is  based  on  the  
            historical preference for fee-in-lieu alternatives within the development community. For  
            instance, since the implementation of parkland dedication fees in July 2019, no land has  
            been dedicated; developers have consistently opted for the fee-in-lieu. Similarly, a fee-in-  
            lieu option was introduced for Mixed Income Housing Development Bonuses in 2022.  

           What was discussed at public hearings?  
  
           The discussions at ZOAC and CPC meetings centered on a proposal to eliminate the  
            ability   of   property   owners   to   initiate   proceedings   to   set   a   compliance   date   for  
            nonconforming  uses.  This  proposal  stemmed  from  concerns  about  the  substantial  
           financial  burden  imposed  on  the  City  by  SB  929.  After  careful  consideration  of  these  
           factors  and  the  associated  financial  risks,  the  City  Plan  Commission  recommended  
            removing  the  provision  that  allowed  residents  to  file  applications  for  compliance  
            deadlines. This decision reflects the majority of the commission's belief that the financial  
            implications of SB 929 outweigh the potential benefits of allowing residents to initiate such  
            proceedings.  

                                                                “Service First, Now!”

   DATE  November 8, 2024                                                                                  CITY OF DALLAS  
  
     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee  
  
SUBJECT  Oak Cliff Cultural District Designation Planning Status Update  
  
  
         Background Information  
  
         As authorized by H.B. 2208 of the 79th Legislature, the Texas Commission on the Arts  
         (TCA) can designate cultural districts in cities across Texas. Cultural districts are special  
         zones that harness the power of cultural resources to stimulate economic development  
         and   community   vitality.   These   districts   can   become   focal   points   for   generating  
         businesses, attracting tourists, stimulating cultural development and fostering civic pride.  
  
         TCA recognizes that a thriving creative sector is a powerful economic development asset.  
         Cultural district designation is one strategy that helps a community boost their economies  
         while realizing other cultural and civic benefits. The outcomes of cultural districts extend  
         beyond  the  arts  and  can  benefit  all  members  of  a  community.  Goals  may  include:  
         attracting artists and cultural enterprises to the community, encouraging business and job  
         development,          addressing         specific      needs      of    a    community,         establishing        tourism  
         destinations,        preserving        and      reusing      historic     buildings,       fostering       local     cultural  
         development.  
  
         TCA’s guidelines for Cultural District Designation requires districts to report annually on  
         activities in order to maintain their designation status.  
  
         Proposed Area for Cultural District Designation: Oak Cliff  
  
         The  proposed  Oak  Cliff  Cultural  District  is envisioned as  a  vibrant,  inclusive  hub  that  
         celebrates   the   diverse   cultural   tapestry   of   our   community’s   artistic   and   cultural  
         expressions.  Our  proposal  focuses  on  fostering  creativity,  preserving  history,  and  
         leveraging the arts as a catalyst for economic growth and community development. We  
         believe that the establishment of this cultural district aligns with the TCA’s commitment to  
         enhancing the cultural landscape of Texas.

           area in southern Dallas, our proposed Oak Cliff Cultural District would be a gateway to  
           the arts and culture scene found in abundance throughout Oak Cliff.  
           Discussions  began  in early  2022  that  the  organic buildup of  the  Jefferson  Boulevard,  
           Davis Street and Bishop Arts District areas would make for a well-defined cultural district.  
           Jefferson with its mix of Latino retailers and cultural events; Bishop Arts with over 40  
           decades   of   eclecticism   and   Bohemian   mix   and   Davis   with   its   complete   street  
           redevelopment  –   all  areas  bustling  with  restaurants,  retailers,  public  art,  historic  
           structures, and attractions all come together to celebrate and promote some “tent-pole”  
           events enjoyed by the thousands throughout the footprint.  
           The  proposed  Oak  Cliff  Cultural  District  includes  the  east  and  west  sides  of  Zang  
           Boulevard from 12th Street running north to West Davis; North and south sides of West  
           Davis moving westward to Rosemont Avenue. East and west sides of Rosemont south to  
           12th Street, east and west sides to S Willomet Avenue east and west sides south to W  
           Brooklyn Ave east to Buckalew St north to W Page Avenue east to S Tyler Street moving  
           north to 12th Street east to Zang Boulevard. (See attached map in Appendix A.)  
  
           The proposed Oak Cliff Cultural District is naturally designed to accommodate visitors  
           traveling by streetcar, bikes, public transport, autos or on foot. Estimated walking time  
           from east end to west end is a little under 30 minutes and about 12 minutes north to south.  
           Visitors  can  spend  a  half-  or  full-day  immersed  in  the  cultural  amenities  found  in  the  
           footprint including restaurants, studios, galleries, public art, municipal buildings, churches,  
           restaurants, concert and theater venues, a city-owned cultural center and library, and  
           other venues for arts and events.  
           Additionally, visitors can attend monthly celebrations across the proposed area at the  
           Zora Neale Hurston Festival (January), 15th Annual Dash for the Beads Walk/ Run, Mardi  
           Gras Parade (February), Dallas Arts Month, ART214, Oak Cliff Earth Day celebration  
           (April), SpeedBump Art Tour, 32nd Annual Cinco de Mayo Parade, Heritage 47th Annual  
           Home Tour or the Dallas is Lit Festival (May) or Orgullo (Pride) Festival, Oak Cliff Film  
           Festival (June), Bastille on Bishop (July), Kaiju Go! Japanese Monster Film, Art & Toy  
           Showcase  (August),  Taste  of  Oak  Cliff,  Hay  Forum,  or  Rising  Stars  Art  Exhibit  
           (September),  Flamenco  Festival  (September/  October),  Dia  de  Los  Muertos  Festival  
           (November),  Jingle  Bell  on  Bishop,  La  Virgen  de  Guadalupe  Parade  and  Holiday  
           Poinsettia Walk (December).

        Program

        by City Council:  
  
        File ID: 24-3378: Authorize the City Manager or her designee to exercise the second of  
        two  one-year renewal  options  for the  service  contract  with  Senior  Citizens  of  Greater  
        Dallas,  Inc.  d/b/a  the  Senior  Source,  as  a  sole  source,  to  provide  nursing  home  
        ombudsman services, which includes: receiving, investigating and resolving complaints  
        and assisting in obtaining goods or services for seniors residing in nursing homes and  
        assisted living facilities within the city of Dallas with a term beginning on December 1,  
        2024 through November 30, 2025  -  Not to exceed $150,868.00, increasing the contract  
        amount from 301,736.00 to $452,604.00-  Financing:  General Fund (subject to annual  
        appropriations)  
  
        Background  
        This authorization represents the second renewal of a contract with Senior Source for the  
        implementation  of  the  Senior  Ombudsman Program.  For almost  40  years,  the  City  of  
        Dallas has partnered with Senior Citizens of Greater Dallas, Inc. (“Senior Source”), to  
        serve  older  adults  in  our  community,  including  support  for  a  key  initiative,  the  Senior  
        Services Ombudsman Program. City funds have long supported this project to promote  
        safety in Dallas assisted living and nursing home facilities, bolstering local capacity of  
        staff and volunteers to make proactive and responsive visits to these facilities, and to  
        conduct outreach and engagement with older adults residing in these facilities, and their  
        families. The goal of the program is to assist residents and to protect their health, safety,  
        welfare and rights. This is accomplished through advocacy efforts of volunteer and paid  
        certified ombudsmen who respond to long-term care residents’ requests for assistance  
        with complaints and concerns. Nursing home and assisted living monitoring by certified  
        ombudsmen   include   observation,   research,   and   investigation   of   concerns.   The  
        Ombudsman Program is also a resource for residents and families searching for a long-  
        term care facility. The program provides training to nursing home and assisted living staff,  
        as well as resident and family councils, on residents’ rights, the role of the ombudsman,  
        abuse and neglect, and reducing restraint use.  
  
        About this funding request  
        Funding for this item will enable the Senior Source to continue to provide ombudsman  
        services to  seniors who  are  residents  of  nursing  homes and  assistant  living facilities  in  

                                                             “Service First, Now!”

           the City of Dallas. The Senior Source will provide these services to approximately 2,700  
           seniors for a one-year period. Funding supports staff, both those who make the visits and  
           those who recruit and train volunteers, as well as training costs. The staff and volunteers  
           enabled by City support allow for numerous additional visits, where staff and volunteers  
           observe the facilities, living conditions and treatment of residents first-hand, and are able  
           to interact with residents, receive complaints or concerns related to resident safety or  
           other issues, and through the Senior Source’s designation as ombudsman, are able to  
           respond to and address complaints. Examples of the types of complaints received include  
           lack of staff assistance, resident neglect (eg bed sores), special dietary needs not being  
           met, discharges and evictions, and other critical issues.
