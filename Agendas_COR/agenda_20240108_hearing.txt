                       Landmark Commission Agenda  
                                Monday, January 8, 2024  
                                                                         
                  3. That the request for a  Certificate of Appropriateness  
                     to construct an 8-foot tall, stained wood privacy fence  
                     in  the  rear  and  partial  east  cornerside  (SW3524  
                     "Chestnut"  semi-transparent  stain)  be  approved  in  
                     accordance with drawings dated 12/1/23 and 12/6/23.   
                     The  proposed  work  is  consistent  with  preservation  
                     criteria Section 51P-225.109  (b)(2) regarding fences,  
                     the    standards       in   City    Code      Section      51A- 
                     4.501(g)(6)(C)(i)  for  contributing  structures,  and  the  
                     Secretary of the Interior’s Standards.  
                  4. That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                     to remove the existing front driveway and replace with  
                     a new brush-finish concrete driveway and parking pad  
                     be  approved  in  accordance  with  drawings  dated  
                     12/1/23   and   12/6/23   with   the   findings   that   this  
                     particular lot, like many in the State-Thomas Historic  
                     District,  is  small  and  mostly  taken  up  by  the  main  
                     structure  and  offers  little  opportunity  for  off-street  
                     parking, and that more surface is needed for parking  
                     than   is   ordinarily   afforded   by   the   criteria.      The  
                     proposed       work     is   otherwise      consistent      with  
                     preservation       criteria   Section     51P-225.109(b)(8)  
                     regarding   sidewalks,   driveways   and   curbing,  the  
                     standards in City Code Section 51A-4.501(g)(6)(C)(i)  
                     for  contributing  structures,  and  the  Secretary  of  the  
                     Interior’s Standards.  
                  Task Force Recommendation:  
                  1. A  Certificate of Appropriateness to construct a 6-foot  
                     tall “wrought iron” fence in the interior side yard facing  
                     Hibernia     Street.   No   quorum.      Supportive.      No  
                     comments.  
                  2. A  Certificate of Appropriateness to construct a 4-foot  
                     tall “wrought iron” fence  in the cornerside yard facing  
                     Boll Street.  No quorum.  Comments only.  Supportive.   
                     A 4-foot fence on top of the retaining wall is a concern.   
                     However, it is necessary for additional security and for  
                     a dog as the property will be used as residential.  Also,  
                     because that fence is open and does not obscure the  
                     house, one foot will make little difference.   
                  3. A Certificate of Appropriateness to construct an 8-foot  
                     tall, stained wood privacy fence in the rear and partial  
                     east     cornerside       (SW3524        "Chestnut"       semi- 
                     transparent  stain).    No  quorum.    Supportive.    No  
                     comments.  
                  4. A   Certificate   of   Appropriateness   to   remove   the  
                     existing front driveway and replace with a new brush- 
                     finish   concrete   driveway   and   parking   pad.      No  
                     quorum.  Supportive.  No comments.

                      windows be all wood with no cladding. Implementation  
                      of these conditions would allow the proposed work to
