     NOTE: HUD generally uses the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) area definitions in the calculation of income limit program parameters. However, to  
     ensure that program parameters do not vary significantly due to area definition changes, HUD has used custom geographic definitions for the Dallas, TX HUD  
     Metro FMR Area.  

     The Dallas, TX HUD Metro FMR Area  contains the following areas: Collin County, TX; Dallas County, TX; Denton County, TX; Ellis County, TX; Hunt County, TX;

Out-of-school-time programs  

Make a  difference  for  youth  by:  

  
       •   Keeping  children  safe  

             Juvenile  crime  triples between  the  hours  of 3 & 6  pm.,  hours  when  children  are  more  likely  to experiment  

             with risky behaviors.  

       •   Closing  the  opportunity  gap  

             By  the  time  they  reach  the  8th  grade,  low-income  children  have  experienced  6,000  fewer  hours  of  

             enrichment activities compared to  middle-income children.  

       •   Inspiring kids to learn and stay engaged in school  

             Attendance, grades and graduation rates are directly linked to high quality afterschool programs.  

       •   Supporting social-emotional development  

             Last year, 85% of students in our partner  programs showed improved mental  health aptitudes based on a  

             nationally-used assessment tool.  

       •   Building  communities :  Out-of-school  time  programs  foster  a  sense  of  belonging  and  connection  to  the  

           community, helping children feel valued and supported.  

                                                                                                                                                             36

OST and Early Childhood programs  

Make a  difference  for  the  workforce  by:  

  
        •   Supporting working families  

               By allowing parents to stay in the workforce, these  programs promote economic mobility, housing stability, and food  

               security.  

        •    Increasing tax revenue  

               Texas loses $1.8 billion annually in tax revenue from parents who chose not to work because of a lack of childcare.  

        •    Bolstering productivity  

               Texas    loses    around    $7.59    billion    in    productivity    every    year    due    to    employee    absences    caused  

               by lack of reliable childcare.  

        •    Building the workforce  

               These programs themselves are significant employers, with over 46,000 Texans working in the out-of-school-time and  

               childcare sectors. By providing ongoing professional development opportunities, agencies like Dallas Afterschool and  

               Educational First Steps contribute to the overall uplift of the economy.  

  
  
                                                                                                                                                                                 37

The current OST landscape  
  
Is  in a  state  of  crisis  

  
 •   Unmet demand is at an all-time high.  

 •   For every child in an afterschool program  
     in Dallas, 3 are waiting to get in.  

 •   Annual turnover rate for OST workforce  
     averages           as     high      as     70%,       forcing  
     programs to operate below capacity.  

 •   This gap leaves over 100,000 children in  
     Dallas   without   a   safe   place   to   go  
     afterschool.

Why Dallas Afterschool  

To  fill  a  critical  gap  that  is  unique  to  OST  

  
  • A    2007      study      found        no    unifying       agency         existed       to    facilitate  
    communication,              learning,       or    information          exchange          among          the  
    hundreds of nonprofit afterschool agencies in Dallas.  

  
  • Free  and  low-cost  afterschool  programs  have  no  safety  or  quality  
    standards.  

  
  • Free and low-cost afterschool programs receive no public oversight.  

  
  • These  programs  have   no  tuition,  receive  no  public  subsidies,  and  
    therefore generate no revenue.  

  
  • OST educators receive no professional development.  

  
                                                                                                                                                                  41

Impact of ARPA Grant Program  

Advance  OST programs  along the quality  
continuum  

• All  12 OST providers mastered their safety exams.  

• Five  afterschool  programs  gained  certification  as  
  operating at the highest level of quality.  

• 500    students       now      attend       afterschool         programs  
  certified by Dallas Afterschool.  

• 70% of students passed STAAR reading assessments  
  (compared to 66% of matched peers in DISD).  

*Early Childhood Programs are already licensed and  
therefore do not require outside assessments.
