Why ethics are important?  
Good fences make…  Good neighbors 

         Professor “Fritz” 

    Commitment to ethical behavior is the fence that keeps Professor Fritz from digging up our garden. 
                                                                                     3

 Why build an ethical fence here? 

  • To ensure you don’t get hurt 
  (disciplined, passed over,  
  blamed, become a pawn in  
  somebody else's chess game,  
  etc.) 

  • To ensure others don’t get hurt 
                                                              “(commitment to ethical behavior is) the fence  
  (treated unfairly, left out, Riggs                          that keeps out the goats that will eat all the  
  bank, etc.)                                                 young shoots in your garden." ~ Jon Kabat-Zinn

      Important Secret About the Fence (Ethics) 

YOU ARE THE FENCE 

        Wherever you will be working, the fence will only be as strong as you. 

          The only thing needed for Professor Fritz to get away with ethical  
                 violations is for good people to do nothing about it.       12

Bumping into a conflict: § 12A-24 

• If a conflict arises recuse yourself: 
    •  From the time of recognition,

    •  Promptly disclose to the city secretary and …. 

    PRO TIP: A person can only recuse if there is a conflict. If there 
    is the   appearance     of a  conflict, then   the  person   needs    to 
    consider   if disclosure   makes    the   most   sense   and   perhaps 
    finding another way to handle the matter that does not have the 
    appearance issue.

 Both are defined as 

1.  a voluntary transfer of property or the conferral of a benefit, 

2.  with no equal or greater value received in return (§12A-2(15) and (19)). 

                                                                                  51

  or officials.

Options with Gifts 

Three options: 
1. Accept;  
2.  Refuse; or  
3.  Receive and donate (§12A-12(a)(5). 

Note: This is not a recusal situation. Either you can accept the 
gift,  or  you  cannot. You  cannot  accept  a  prohibited gift  and 
deal with it by following the recusal process.

When Is a Gift Prohibited? - §12A-12(a) 

The general rule is that a gift is prohibited when it: 

1. Reasonably        tends     to   influence     or   reward     official 
    conduct; or 

2. The  city  official  or  employee  knows  it  is  intended to 
    influence or reward the discharge of official duties. 

                                                                      54 

----------------------- Page 58-----------------------

Is there more guidance? 

YES, the Code sets out specific elements to help with  
the following: 

    1. Recognitions such as honorariums, public awards, and  
       ceremonial/protocol gifts; 
   2.  Meals, travel, lodging, and entertainment; 
   3. Tickets; 
   4.  Relation based gifts (relatives, friends, etc.); and  
   5.  Loans and scholarships. 

                                                                            55

                        Analyzing Gifts 

  Three steps to analyze if a gift is allowable or prohibited: 

   1. § 12A-12 general rule. 
  2. § 12A-12 listed exceptions and special rules. 
  3. Department rules that are stricter. 

                                                                             56 

Example of step three: some departments have a no gift policy.

  Reporting of Gifts - §12A-42 

  1. Find the form on the city secretary’s web  page or 
     build your own. 
  2. Submit the report in an electronic format. 
  3. Certain city officials are  required to file a “no gift” 
     report if no gift was  accepted  in the  quarter. See 
     §12A-42(c) for the complete list of those  required 
     to file a “no gift” report. 

                                                                          59 

Forms do not need to be sworn (no affidavit required). 

----------------------- Page 63-----------------------

What’s It Worth? 

1.   Face value – the price to buy the 
    ticket from  the vendor  even  if the 
    ticket   has    no    price   or   says 
     “complimentary”. 
2.   Fair  market     value   –   what   the 
     public will pay for the ticket. 
3.   Estimate – educated guess. 

Pro-tip:  ask  the  donor  for  the  value 
and  get  something  in writing  for  your 
records. 

                                                                                           60 

----------------------- Page 64-----------------------

What counts as a year? 

• Gift reporting is based on the calendar year. 

• Gift totaling for calculating cumulative totals of small gifts 
  is  based     on   the   calendar     year   (The    Code     requires 
  cumulative gifts of $300 or more from a single source in a 
  single  year  to  be  reported  (§12A-42(a)(3). So, to  figure 
  out  the  cumulative  value  of  multiple  gifts,         go  back  to 
  January  1st and count all gifts since that date, but none 
  before that date).
