 Program Background  

  
To  ensure the success  of the  City  of  Dallas  Upskilling  Pilot  Program,  it  was  crucial  to  establish  partnerships  
with  departments  based on  the  number  of  employees  making  below  the  $46,000 wage threshold.  The  
graph  below  shows  the  number  of employees  making  below  the  $46,000 wage  threshold  by  department

  Potential Interventions  

What ideas do you think could be impactful and feasible?  
•   Listening session with employees – to gather information to develop personalized programs that  
   connect and engage with their  needs  
•   Coordinating lunch and learn sessions with managers - better understand how we can support them  
   support their teams  
•   Identifying leadership champions  – pitch to city leaders to gain support  
•   Creating a career ladder system to add clarity and visibility to growth opportunities within the  
   organization  
•   Coordinating job rotation and cross-departmental learning opportunities  
•   Bringing in role models to mentor participants  
•   Collecting data on existing programs, certifications, and support mechanisms  
  
How would you adjust which interventions you focus on with a DEIB lens in mind?  
•   These interventions support a program that is designed with a DEIB lens in  mind.  
•   Role models and program coordinators will reflect diverse backgrounds.  
•   Include COD Employee Resource Groups in  program design and networking.  
•   Consider barriers for  participation and offer support services (e.g., childcare, language)

      Q.  How  are  soft  skills  being  incorporated  into  the  training for  employees  
      moving up through the ranks?  
      A. When the Upskilling Team meets with the candidates, we identify all  
      their development needs which include soft skills.  We have created a  
      library of development resources that include both technical and soft  
      skills. Click here to visit the Upskilling SharePoint site. The HR Training &  
      Development team is currently developing new curriculum for a  
      restructured leadership development program with a strong emphasis on  
      interpersonal and people manager skills with an application focus. The  
      restructured program will roll out early 2025.

    Q. Have there been any conversations with DPD regarding the interest of  
    security officers in transitioning to DPD?  
    A.  The Upskilling Team connected with the Dallas Police Department on  
    September  17,  2024.  Dallas  Police  Department  expressed  interest  in  the  
    stepladder  opportunity  but  asked  that  we  delay  a  continuation  of  the  
    conversation after the closing  of the State Fair  of Texas on October 20,  
    2024. The Upskilling Team will reach out to the Dallas Police Department

     Q. What is the status of merit pay for employees in the identified departments?  
     A. During each annual budget review, City Council determines/approves funding  
     for merit increases for City of Dallas employees. In recent years, Council has approved  
     a budget that allows an average of a 3 percent increase for each City  
     department/office to utilize for merits. The Office of Budget allocates the approved  
     budgeted amount to each department/office. The FY2024 year-end performance  
     evaluation process for all employees begins in October 2024 and based on  
     performance ratings, the appropriate merit percentages will be awarded in January  
     2025.

    Q. How are we addressing the public safety component, particularly for security staff at  
    City Hall who have been in low-paying positions for extended periods?  

    A. The Upskilling Team met with the Marshal’s Office and the HR Compensation team  
    on September 28, 2024, to discuss a comprehensive pathway for individuals, starting  
    from entry-level positions with minimal experience to advanced roles within the security  
    field. This will include a stepladder of both horizontal and vertical opportunities within  
    Security, Marshal’s Office and the Dallas Police Department. The series includes  
     Detention Officers, Security Officers, Marshals and Dallas Police Officers. The stepladder  
    is currently in development with the HR Compensation team.  Also, we want to  
    emphasize that both the security officers and the Marshals are paid within the  
    appropriate range based on record compensation study.

SUBJECT  Update on 2024 Dallas Youth Survey and Dallas Youth Collaborative  
  
        The Office of Community Care and Empowerment (OCCE) is excited to provide an update  
        on the 2024 Dallas Youth Survey, which launched on October 1, 2024, and will run until  
         November 30, 2024. The City strategically engages youth through the Youth Commission  
        and College Advisory Council and offers enrichment services targeting higher-risk youth  
        populations,  including  opportunity  youth,  through  youth  development  and  intervention  
        programs,  administered  through  the  Office  of  Community  Care  and  Empowerment  
        (OCCE). The Dallas Youth Survey is an initiative of the Dallas Youth Commission and the  
         National  Civic  League  (NCL).  The  College  Advisory  Commission  also  supports  the  
        development of the survey and is leading the distribution plan for students over the age  
        of  18  years.  The  goal  of  the  survey  is to  collect  responses  from  over 5,000  students  
        between the ages of 13 and 24 across Dallas, with a focus on gathering critical data  
        regarding  their  perspectives  on  key  areas  such  as  education,  safety,  mental  health,  
        workforce readiness, and civic engagement.  
  
        The  survey  will  provide  a  robust  and  representative  dataset  that  will  help  us  better  
        understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities for Dallas youth. These insights will  
        directly inform our future program development, recommendations, and priorities in areas  
        like workforce development, education reform, and youth violence prevention. We are  
        working in close partnership with Dallas ISD, Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD, Harmony  
         ISD,  Highland  Park  ISD,  Richardson  ISD,  charter  schools,  local  colleges,  community  
        centers,  and  youth-serving  organizations,  to  ensure  diverse  participation,  including  
        outreach to underserved populations and opportunity youth.  
  
        Additionally, this survey serves as a pilot to assess the feasibility of future expansions.  
        While this survey is administered only in English at this time, there are plans for future  
        surveys  to  incorporate  multiple  languages,  based  on  feedback,  and  reflective  of  the  
        evolving demographics of the youth population in Dallas.  
  
        A  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  results  of  the  survey  will  be  shared  with  the  WEE  
        Committee in FY25. The findings will support the City's planning around youth-related  
        programs, ensuring they are evidence-based and reflective of the identified needs of our  
        young people.  
  
        Dallas Youth Collaborative Launch Luncheon Recap  
  
        On October 3, 2024, OCCE convened the Dallas Youth Collaborative at City Hall. The  
        event  brought  together  over  25  educational  institutions  and  community  organizations  
        committed  to  focus  on  fostering  collaboration  on  youth-focused  initiatives.  During  the  

                                                              “Service First, Now!”

             luncheon,   several   organizations   signed   pledges   of   support,   signifying   a   citywide  
             commitment  to  working  together  on  programs  that  empower  and  uplift  young  people.  
             Attendees  had  the  opportunity  to  discuss  strategic  priorities  for  the  Dallas  Youth  
             Collaborative,  including  leadership  development,  safety,  educational  attainment,  and  
             youth engagement.  
  
             This event marked an important milestone in unifying efforts across the city, and we are  
             confident  that  the  Youth  Collaborative  will  enhance  opportunities  for  youth  in  Dallas  
             through sustained partnerships and collective action.  
  
             We look forward to sharing further updates on both the survey and the Dallas Youth  
             Collaborative’s initiatives in the coming months. Please contact myself or Jessica

SUBJECT  Update on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration Week Planning  
  
         The purpose of this memo is to provide an update on planning for the 2025 Dr. Martin  
         Luther King, Jr. Celebration Week, including events and awards gala.  
  
         This year’s events commemorate the 43rd   annual celebration of Dr. King’s legacy. The  
         theme  of  this  year’s  celebration  week,  as  selected  by  the  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.  
         Community Center Advisory Board, is "The Unfinished Agenda of Dr. Martin Luther King,  
         Jr.: Where do we go now?". This theme will advise all planning, speaker topics, and the  
         scholarship prompt.  
  
         Planning for the week’s events is currently underway, with a tentative schedule of events  
         included below. Due to the fact that  Inauguration Day is scheduled for January 20, 2025,  
         which is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, staff and the Advisory Board together have decided  
                                                                                     th 
         to hold the traditional parade on Saturday, January  18  , rather than on Monday, January  
         20th , as in years past. Additionally, the Gala and several other events will be held the  
         weekend prior, due to capacity considerations for all involved.  
  
         Celebration Week Schedule of Events:  
  
         Friday 1/10/2025                     Candle Lighting Ceremony  
         Saturday 1/11/2025                   MLK Fest + MLK Gala  
         Tuesday 1/14/2025                   Day of Reflection  
         Wednesday 1/15/2025                  Job Fair  
         Thursday 1/16/2025                  Youth Event  
         Friday 1/17/2025                    Equity Symposium  
         Saturday 1/18/2025                   Parade  
  
        As planning continues, staff will provide additional updates. If you have any questions,  
         please contact myself or Office of Community Care and Empowerment Director Jessica

SUBJECT  Office of Equity and Inclusion – Human Rights Workshop Update  
  
        Background  
        This memo reports on the progress by the Office of Equity and  Inclusion (OEI) in leading  
        a human rights workshop, which will inform the development of a human rights task force.  
        OEI has confirmed October 31, 2024 to host a workshop in collaboration with key human  
        rights stakeholders and partners. In February 2024 OEI briefed the WEE Committee on  
        originally  exploring  a  formalized  Human  Rights  Commission.  Based  on  the  results  of  
        engagement and research across 18 other U.S. cities, OEI led a full presentation to the  
        WEE Committee in June 2024, and WEE called for OEI to host a human rights workshop  
        to continue engaging additional stakeholders and to identify potential human rights issues  
        residents  may  face  in  their  daily  lives  with  the  goal  of  addressing  through  municipal  
        strategies.  

  
        Human Rights Workshop Two-Part Focus  
        OEI  received  guidance  from  the  WEE  Committee  during  the  last  memo  update  in  
        September  2024  to  maintain  a  focus  on  advancing  human  rights  at  the  City  Dallas  
        independently from what is called for by  North Texas hosting the World Cup in 2026.  
        While separate, OEI saw a need to complement efforts because of intersections between  
        stakeholders to engage, the timing for this planned engagement, and overlap in some of  
        the human rights issue areas that need to be assessed. Teams proposed hosting a full-  
        day workshop with two independent components. Following a morning session with a  
        focus on the World Cup led by the North Texas FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee,  
        OEI  in  the  afternoon  will  then  take  the  lead  for  the  City  of  Dallas  in  engaging  area  
        stakeholders across the following human rights areas informed by WEE priority areas: (1)  
        Inclusion  and  Safeguarding  (Vulnerable  Populations),  (2)  Re-Entry,  (3)  Veterans,  (4)  
        Migrants,  (5)  Worker’s  Rights,  (6)  Housing  and  Homelessness,  and  (7)  Safety  and  
        Security/Policing.  
  
        These seven focus areas allow the City of Dallas to stand apart by not only taking the  
        opportunity to examine the human rights intersections across existing  City services and  
        daily activities, but also be strategic in gathering insight on the front-end to inform potential  
        efforts.

            OEI  has  engaged  a  consultant  to  inform  the  overall  design  of  the  Human  Rights  
            Workshop, and efforts led by OEI include the following components:  

  
                 1.   Stakeholder  and Landscape  Assessment  Templates  for  City  Colleagues  –  
                     OEI sent templates across key City departments beginning in September 2024  
                     requesting the contact information of stakeholders OEI should engage. OEI further  
                     collected information on departments’ existing programs, services, activities, and  
                     additional issues with the goal of ensuring strategies proposed are not duplicative.  
                2.   Pre-Activity for Stakeholders  –  For each human rights area, stakeholders will  
                     complete  a  pre-activity  to  prioritize  the  impact  of  specific  human  rights  issues  
                     across different activities, identify the groups impacted, and describe the adverse  
                     impact. Additional space is provided for stakeholders to identify issues not already  
                     included.  
                3.  Workshop Axes Exercise with Facilitators  –  OEI will have seven issue area  
                     facilitators who  lead  each group of  stakeholders through an  axes exercise  that  
                     allows stakeholders to come together to prioritize previously-identified issues and  
                     those submitted by stakeholders in the pre-activity.  
  
            Based  on  issues  prioritized  by  stakeholders  during  the  workshop,  OEI  will  develop  
            strategies to address taking into consideration already existing efforts at the City of Dallas.  
            Before finalization, OEI looks forward to briefing the WEE Committee by December 2024  
            on the results of the workshop and plans for an ongoing Human Rights Task Force as an  
            implementation partner.  

  
            Next Steps – Invitation to WEE Members  
            OEI included key staff from all Mayor and City Council Offices on the Save the Date sent  
            out on September 30, 2024, and OEI looks forward to WEE’s engagement not only during  
            the  City  of  Dallas  portion  of  workshop,  but  also  in  later  supporting  implementation  of  
            strategies developed. If you have any questions, please contact myself or Dr. Lindsey
