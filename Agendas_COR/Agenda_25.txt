Police Report:  
  
According to the police report, on 10/13/2024 at approximately 3:30 am, Officer Boisjolie  
initiated  a  traffic  stop  after  observing  a  Chevrolet  Malibu  cut  in  front  of  him  without  
signaling. The Malibu continued and made a wide right turn without signaling within 100  
feet. Officer Boisjolie stopped the vehicle and contacted the driver, who was identified as  
Elijah Hannah. During the initial contact, Officer Boisjolie asked Hannah if he had any  
weapons, and  Hannah  produced an unholstered handgun,  which Officer Boisjolie took  
possession of. Officer Boisjolie wrote that he observed Hannah to be “disoriented, have  
bloodshot eyes, and have mood changes.” Hannah denied consuming alcohol or smoking  
drugs.   

Based   on   Hannah’s   driving   and   personal   behavior,   Officer   Boisjolie   conducted  
standardized field sobriety tests on Hannah. Hannah initially refused the tests, stating that  
he had not been drinking. However, he did submit to the horizontal gaze nystagmus test.  
Officer Boisjolie wrote that “no clues were observed” during this test.  Hannah refused to  
do any other tests and again stated that the reason for his refusal was that he had not  
been drinking alcohol.   

Officer Boisjolie placed Hannah under arrest for driving while intoxicated (Penal Code  
49.04) due to his belief that Hannah was intoxicated, had lost the regular use of his mental  
and  or  physical  faculties  due  to  the  introduction  of  alcohol,  drugs,  dangerous  drugs,  
controlled substances, a combination of two or more of those substances or any other  
substance and was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely.  Hannah was also arrested  
for unlawful carrying a weapon while intoxicated (Penal Code 46.02(b)).  After the arrest,  
Hannah  was  found  to  have  approximately  .86  grams  of  Marijuana  on  him.  Hannah  
submitted to a blood test.    

Body Worn Camera (BWC) and Dash Cam Review  

Dash Cam  

3:29:27           Officer  Boisjolie  is  following  a  gray  Chevrolet  Malibu  driven  by  Elijah  
                  Hannah. The Malibu is traveling westbound in the number 3 lane of E Trinity  
                  Mills Rd. The video footage shows the Malibu  braking for approximately 3  
                 seconds for an unknown reason before continuing on its route.  

3:29:48           Hannah begins to brake as it approaches the Midway Rd intersection, which  
                  is parallel to a now-appearing right-turn-only lane.  

3:29:52           Hannah  turns  on  the  right  turn  signal   approx.   Fifty  feet  before  the  
                  intersection, but does not enter the right turn lane. Hannah turns right from  
                 the number 3 lane onto northbound Midway Rd. Midway is comprised of 3  
                  lanes, and the Malibu does not turn into the number 3 lane but turns into the  
                  number 1 lane.   

                                                  “Service First, Now!”

3:29:58          Officer Boisjolie activates the patrol vehicle's overhead lights. Hannah turns  
                 left into a parking lot and stops the vehicle.    

BWC – Boisjolie 1  

03:30:55         Officer Boisjolie’s  initial contact with driver Hannah in his vehicle .  Officer  
                 Boisjolie explains to Hannah that he had “cut him off.”  

03:31:19         Hannah produces a handgun after being asked if there are weapons in the  
                 vehicle.   

03:34:05         Officer Boisjolie returns to his patrol vehicle for computer checks.  

03:36:45         Officer Boisjolie returns to Hannah’s vehicle and asks Hannah to step out.  

03:41:54         Officer Boisjolie conducts a nystagmus gaze test on Hannah.  

03:45:32         Officer  Boisjolie  finishes  the  nystagmus  gaze  test.    Hannah  refuses  any  
                 other tests.  

03:46:18         Officer Boisjolie places Hannah under arrest.  

BWC – Sgt. Nam 1  

03:31:19         Sgt. Nam arrived on the scene and supervised the entire incident.  

Dallas Police Internal Affairs Preliminary Review:  

In a letter dated 11/5/2024, the Internal Affairs Division stated that after  reviewing the  
information provided  and  reviewing  the  Body  Worn  Camera  recording,  they  could not  
establish a violation of departmental policies or procedures.  Based on the review, they  
have determined that no investigation is warranted.    

Analysis of Probable Cause  
In  the  police  report,  Officer  Boisjolie  stated  that  the  gray  Malibu  failed  to  signal  and  
changed lanes in the front of Officer Boisjolie, cutting him off. This incident is not captured  
on the dash cam.  Officer Boisjolie was driving a marked Dallas  Police patrol vehicle at  
the time.  Officer Boisjolie then stated that the Malibu made a wide right turn.  A dash cam  
review showed that the Malibu turned right from the number 3 lane of Trinity Mills Rd and  
failed to enter the right turn, which was the only lane available for that turn. The dash cam  
also showed the Malibu signaling for the right turn late (not within 100 feet), as stated by  
Officer Boisjolie.  

Officer Boisjolie asked the driver, Elijah Hannah, if he had any weapons in the car, and  
Hannah produced a handgun by grabbing the top of the slide with his left hand and holding  
it up for Officer Boisjolie.    

Officer Boisjolie stated he observed Hannah to be disoriented, with  bloodshot eyes and  
mood changes.  It is unknown what Officer Boisjolie meant by disoriented. The BWC is  

                                                 “Service First, Now!”

not detailed enough to document bloodshot eyes.  Hannah did appear to become upset  
about the traffic  stop and the questions  he was being asked. He would calm down but  
then become agitated again.    

Officer Boisjolie administered a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test, and wrote that no clues  
were observed during it.  

Hannah was asked to complete a walk-and-turn test, at which time he refused to complete  
the test and stated he didn’t have to because he had not been drinking alcohol.  

Review for Rudeness  
During the review of the BWC, no evidence was discovered of Officer Boisjolie being rude  
or discourteous to Hannah.  

Review for Racial Profiling  
During the review of the BWC, no evidence was discovered of Officer Boisjolie racially  
profiling this traffic stop. It is unknown if Officer Boisjolie could see the driver's race prior  
to the stop. This stop occurred during darkness, which would have made it difficult to see  
the vehicle's occupants.    

Blood Test Result  
After the arrest  for driving  while  intoxicated,  Hannah  submitted  to  a  blood  test ,  which  
showed:  
    •   Alcohols & Acetone Negative 
    •   5.5 ng/ml Tetrahydrocannabinol 
    •   42.7 ng/ml Carboxy tetrahydrocannabinol 
    •   2.2 ng/ml hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol 

Further Investigation:  

On  January  22,  2025,  at  1015  hours,  Investigator  Huff  spoke  to  Elijah  Hannah  via  
telephone.  Hannah advised that he had received his blood test results back from his  
arrest, and it showed he did not have any alcohol in his system.  Hannah did say that the  
test revealed he had Marijuana in his system, but he stated he was not intoxicated at the  
time of the arrest.  Hannah stated he last smoked Marijuana about 8 hours before he was  
arrested.    Hannah  said  it  was  about  4:30pm;  he  was  outside  his  apartment  in  his  
apartment complex and took 6 “hits” of  Marijuana.  Hannah said he was with a friend  
named Malcolm, who has the nickname of Slim. He said it wasn’t very much  Marijuana,  
and he was not under the influence when the officer arrested him.  Hannah said he is  
aware that  Marijuana can show in your blood for days after using,  but it does not mean  
you are under the influence.    

Hannah  provided  Malcolm’s  phone  number,  945-201-9263,  but  did  not  think  it  was  
working.  Hannah did not have any other contact info for Malcom.   A call  to  945-201- 
9263 revealed it was a number no longer in service.

----------------------- Page 23-----------------------

On February 18, 2025, Elijah Hannah called Investigator Huff for an update on the case.   
During the call, Hannah explained he felt racially profiled by the officer due to the officer  
immediately asking him if he had guns and drugs in the car.

         Complaint:  

         On April 26, 2024, Eric Williams submitted a complaint to the Dallas  Police Department  
         (DPD) and asserted the following occurred while the Dallas Police were at his residence,  
         due to a verbal argument between him and his wife.  

              •   Sgt Emerson was verbally aggressive, loud and intimidating.  
              •   Sgt Emerson conducted an unlawful search of his person and backpack.  
              •   Sgt Emerson allowed car keys found in Williams’ backpack to be given to his wife,  
                  Gay Williams.   
              •   Williams stated he felt violated, bullied, illegally detained, and robbed.  

         Incident Summary:  

         On April  23,  2024,  at  2:06pm,  Gay  Williams  called  the  police  and  reported  that  her  
         husband, Eric Williams was keeping her from leaving the residence by holding the keys  
         for their vehicle.  Officer LeBourgeois and Officer Levine arrived on scene.  The couple  
         had  been  arguing  but  Gay  Williams  was  prevented  from  leaving  for  work  due  to  Eric  
         Williams  not advising where the car keys were.  Officer LeBourgeois and Officer Levine  

                                                                “Service First, Now!”

were unable to resolve the situation and were concerned if they left , a fight might take  
place, so they called Sgt. Emerson to the scene.    

Upon  arrival,  Sgt.  Emerson  conducted  a  pat-down  of  Eric  Williams,  as  the  initial  call  
indicated he was known to possess firearms.  Williams was wearing a backpack, which  
was searched, revealing a handgun and car keys.  Officer Levine then gave the  keys to  
Gay Williams, who left the scene without further incident.

16:12:36          Officer LeBourgeois finds keys in the backpack and hands them to Officer  
                   Levine, who gives them to Gay Williams.   
  
Internal Affairs Division Investigation:  

The  DPD’s  Internal  Affairs  Division  (IAD)  investigated  Eric  Williams’  complaint  and  
reached the following conclusion:  

         Based  on  the  testimonial,  documentary,  and  video  evidence  collected  
         during  this  investigation,  it  was  determined  that  the  actions  of  Officer  
         LeBourgeois, Officer Levine, and Sergeant Emerson were within policy.  
         Mr. Williams was never deprived of his rights or his property. Therefore,  
         the   allegation   that   Officers   LeBourgeois   and   Levine   and   Sergeant  
         Emerson abused their power by searching Mr. Williams and allowing Ms.  
          Williams to leave in his vehicle is classified as “EXONERATED.”  

           
On January 23, 2025, IAD sent a letter to Mr. Williams stating:   

           “In  the  case  of  your  particular  complaint,  the  investigation  did  
           establish a violation of departmental rules or other issues needing  
           to be addressed by the Chain of Command.”  

OCPO Preliminary Review:  

On  February  25,  2025,  Eric Williams  submitted a  request  to  the Office of  Community  
Police  Oversight  (OCPO)  for  an  Independent  Review  of  his  complaint.  During  the  
preliminary review of the case, the OCPO did not identify any violations of Dallas Police  
Department’s General Orders related to the complaint.

         Incident Summary  
           
         Background of Complaint:  

         On August  16,  2023,  Ruston  Police  Chief  Stephen  Rogers  filed  a  complaint  on  Sgt.  
         Eucora Gray  asserting  that  she  had  filed  a  false  and  malicious  complaint  against  the  
         Ruston Police Department.    

         Details of Sergeant Eucora Gray’s Complaint against Ruston Police:  

         On June 9, 2023, off-duty Dallas Police Sergeant Eucora Gray was visiting her hometown  
         of  Ruston,  Louisiana,  when  her  12-year-old  nephew  was  shot.        The  subsequent  
         investigation into the shooting by the Ruston Police Department prompted Sgt. Gray to  
         write  a  complaint  against  the  Ruston  Police  Department  which  Sgt.  Gray  sent  to  the  
         Ruston Mayor.    

         Sgt. Gray voiced her concerns regarding the Ruston Police Department’s investigation  
         into the shooting. Specifically, she filed  a written complaint with Ruston Mayor Ronny  
         Walker, stating:  

                                                                 “Service First, Now!”

----------------------- Page 28-----------------------

    •    She provided information to Ruston Police detectives regarding the incident but 
        felt she was treated as a suspect during the follow-up. 

    •   The Ruston Police Department displayed bias during the investigation, neglecting 
        to address other victims due to racial factors. 

    •   Additional issues she observed in the investigation were inconsistent with proper 
         investigative procedures. 

In her formal complaint, Sgt. Gray concluded with the following recommendations:  

    •    Implement diversity, ethics, and inclusion training. 

    •    Make racial profiling and anti-bias training mandatory. 

    •    Ensure accountability for fictitious report writing. 

    •    Request federal agencies to audit the Ruston Police Department. 

On  August  7,  2023,  Mayor  Ronny  Walker  responded  to  Sgt.  Gray,  dismissing  her  
allegations as unsupported.  

Internal Affairs Division Investigation:  

The  Dallas  Police  Department  Internal  Affairs  Division  investigated  this  complaint.   
Internal Affairs Division concluded that Sergeant Gray did not use her position and/or rank  
in the Dallas Police Department to influence the investigation of her juvenile nephew’s  
case.    

On April 10, 2024, the Internal Affairs Division sent a letter to Ruston Police Chief Stephen  
Rogers which stated the investigation was unable to establish a violation of departmental  
rules.    

OCPO Preliminary Review:  

On April 18, 2024, Ruston Police Chief Stephen Rogers submitted an investigation review  
request to the Office of Community Police Oversight.  After a preliminary review, the Office  
of Community Police Oversight was unable to establish a violation of the Dallas Police  
Department departmental policies and procedures.    

Conclusion  

After reviews by both the Internal Affairs Division and the Office of Community Police  
Oversight,  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  allegations  of  misconduct  by  Sergeant  
Eucora Gray in connection with the Ruston Police Department’s investigation.  

Should further questions or concerns arise regarding this matter, please direct them to  
the Office of Community Police Oversight.

        Memorandum  

                                                                                                CITY OF DALLAS  
   DATE  March 18, 2025  

     TO  Members of the Community Police Oversight Board  

SUBJECT  Briefing of Senate Bill 1421  

  This memorandum provides an overview of  Senate Bill 1421  (SB 1421), which  addresses  
  the regulation and use of less-lethal force weapons by law enforcement officers in Texas.  
  The  bill  establishes  a  justified  defense  for  officers  in  cases  involving  less-lethal  force  
  weapons, mandates policies and training requirements, and sets minimum standards for law  
  enforcement agencies regarding their use.  

  Key Provisions  

       •   Prosecution:  SB 1421 introduces a new provision to  Section 9.55 of the Texas 
           Penal  Code,  establishing  a  justified  defense  for  peace  officers  and  correctional 
           guards who deploy less-lethal force weapons while performing their official duties. 
           This  defense  is  contingent  upon  the  officer's  adherence  to  training  standards, 
           departmental  policies,  manufacturer  guidelines,  state  laws,  and  established  law 
           enforcement protocols. 
       •   Policy and Training Requirements: Law enforcement agencies that issue less- 
           lethal force weapons must  adopt a policy approved by the Texas Commission on 
           Law  Enforcement  or  follow  a model  policy  provided  by  the  commission.  Officers 
           must also be trained to use all less-lethal weapons and maintain active certifications. 
       •   Restrictions on Use: Officers are prohibited from using less-lethal weapons outside 
           established policies or beyond the allowances of existing state law. Agencies must 
           provide clear guidelines and ensure compliance with the law. 

  Impact  

  SB  1421  enhances  law  enforcement  training  and  policies  by  establishing  legal  
  protections for officers while mandating standardized training on less-lethal force  
  weapons.  If  enacted,  SB  1421  would  require  the  Dallas  Police  Department  to  update  
  policies for all less-lethal weapons and  mandate  officers  to maintain certification. These  
  provisions   will   encourage   responsible  use   of   less-lethal   weapons  while   minimizing  
  excessive-force incidents. For Dallas residents, SB 1421  prioritizes public safety and trust  
  in  law  enforcement   by   promoting   the   use   of   less-lethal   alternatives   and   reducing  
  unnecessary force.

                                                                                                                                  CITY OF DALLAS  

  
    DATE   March 18, 2025  

  
      TO   Members of the Community Police Oversight Board  

  
SUBJECT    Briefing of Senate Bill 1957  

   This memorandum provides an overview of Senate Bill 1957 (SB 1957), which  seeks to  
   amend Chapter 143, Local Government Code, by adding eligibility criteria for individuals  
   serving  on  civilian  oversight  boards  that monitor  firefighters,  police  officers,  or  a  related  
   department.   
     
    Definitions  

    Moral  Turpitude:  Deviant  behavior  that  represents  a  profound  departure  from  moral,  
   ethical, and societal norms, contradicting established principles of justice, integrity, and duty  
   within  society .  It  encompasses  acts  of  dishonesty,  fraud,  deceit,  misrepresentation,  or  
   deliberate violence.   
     
    Key Provisions  
     
         •     New  Eligibility  Requirements:  Individuals  convicted  of  or  placed  on  deferred  
               adjudication for a felony are ineligible to serve. Those convicted of a crime of moral  
               turpitude are also disqualified.  
                 
    Impact  

    If enacted, SB 1457 would strengthen the accountability and credibility of civilian oversight  
    bodies,  including  the  City  of  Dallas  Community  Police  Oversight  Board  (CPOB).  In  the  
    Dallas  City  Charter,  Article  III  outlines  the  requirements  and  disqualifications  for  CPOB  
    member eligibility. The City of Dallas also adheres to Article 1, Section 8-1.4, which governs  
   qualification  considerations  for  board  appointments,  including  disqualifications  based  on  
   serious criminal convictions. SB 1457 does not introduce new restrictions but reinforces  
   existing guidelines for disqualification, aligning with established standards.  
     

                                                                         “Service First, Now!”  
                                                                Connect – Collaborate – Communicate

        Memorandum  

                                                                                               CITY OF DALLAS  

   DATE  March 18, 2025  

     TO  Members of the Community Police Oversight Board  

SUBJECT  Briefing of House Bill 2929  

   This  memorandum  provides  an  overview  of  House  Bill  2929  (HB  2929),  which  aims  to  
   enhance  law  enforcement  training  by  requiring  peace  officers  to  receive  specialized  
   instruction on interacting with individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).   

   Provisions  

       •   Mandatory  Training  Requirement:  HB  2929  amends  Section  1701.253  of  the 
           Occupations Code to include ASD training as part of the minimum curriculum for 
           peace officers. 
       •   Creation of a New Training Program (Section 1701.273): The Texas Commission 
           on Law Enforcement (TCOLE) must develop and maintain evidence-based training 
           that covers ASD identification, effective communication, de-escalation strategies, 
           crisis response, and safety considerations in correctional settings. The training will 
           also address the risks of abuse, coercion, or exploitation of ASD individuals and 
           ensure  officers  understand  the  legal  requirements  for  emergency  detention  and 
           custody procedures. 

   Impact  

   If enacted, HB 2929 would enhance training for all Texas peace officers, including those in  
   departments like the Dallas Police Department (DPD) with specialized crisis response units  
   like the RIGHT Care Team. While the RIGHT Care Team integrates law enforcement with  
   mental health professionals to address crises, HB 2929 ensures that all officers receive  
   standardized training on interacting with individuals with ASD. This legislation would improve  
   officers'  ability to recognize and de-escalate encounters with ASD individuals, leading to  
   more  informed  decision-making  and  reducing  unnecessary  detentions  or  escalations.  
  Additionally,  HB  2929  would  strengthen  coordination  between  patrol  officers  and  crisis  
   response teams by ensuring a department-wide  standard for  understanding ASD-related  
   interactions.  

                                                      “Service First, Now!”  
                                               Connect – Collaborate – Communicate

          Memorandum  

           

           
                                                                                                                            CITY OF DALLAS  

  
    DATE  March 18, 2025  

  
      TO  Members of the Community Police Oversight Board  

  
SUBJECT   Briefing of House Bill 2982  

   This  memorandum  provides  an  overview  of  House  Bill  2982  (HB  2982),  which  aims  to  
   regulate the use of less-lethal projectiles by law enforcement agencies in Texas. HB 2982  
   mandates that all law enforcement agencies adopt policies prohibiting peace officers from  
   deploying less-lethal projectiles, such as rubber bullets and bean bag rounds, to control the  
   movement or activity of a gathering of people.  

   Provisions  

         •     Definition of Less-Lethal Projectiles:  HB 2982 defines less-lethal projectiles as  
               ammunition discharged from a firearm or other device to incapacitate through blunt  
               trauma while minimizing the risk of serious injury or death compared to standard  
               ammunition. Examples of less-lethal projectiles include rubber and wood bullets as  
               well as sponge and bean bag rounds.  
         •     Policy  Requirement  for  Law  Enforcement  Agencies:  Each  law  enforcement  
               agency in Texas must establish a policy prohibiting the use of less-lethal projectiles  
               for crowd control.  

   Impact  

    If enacted, HB 2982 would require the Dallas Police Department (DPD) to reassess its crowd  
   control  policies. While DPD’s  General Orders already prohibit firing 40mm Stinger rounds  
   into crowds, the bill may further limit the deployment of Pepper Ball rounds and other indirect  
   saturation methods for dispersing gatherings. Compliance with HB 2982 would necessitate  
   updates  to  officer  training,  emphasizing  alternative  de-escalation  tactics  and  ensuring  a  
   clear understanding of new limitations.  As a result, it may increase the reliability of other  
   less-lethal options and adopt reformative operational strategies for managing large-scale  
   public demonstrations.  
     

                                                                      “Service First, Now!”  
                                                             Connect – Collaborate – Communicate

    Introduction   
      
    Civilian  oversight  of  law  enforcement  often  emerges  in  response  to  community  
    demands for greater accountability, especially following high-profile incidents. As an  
    institution  dedicated  to  representing  community  interests,  civilian  oversight  bodies  
    must  actively  engage  with  local  communities  and  stakeholders.   With  effective  
    outreach, civilian oversight raises awareness by facilitating the dissemination of reports  
    and findings, strengthening  relationships with stakeholders, encouraging  community  
    input, and enhancing  the  civilian oversight’s problem-solving capacity. These efforts  
    are essential for promoting civilian oversight's mission of transparency, accountability,  
    accessibility, and public trust.  
       
    This Community Outreach and Engagement Plan provides a systematic approach for  
    identifying  community  partners,  developing  educational  materials,  utilizing  social  
    media   as   a   communication   tool,   and   encouraging   individual   and   community  
    participation.  The  primary  objective   is  to  increase  awareness  of  the  Office  of  
    Community  Police  Oversight  (OCPO  or  office),  the  Community  Police  Oversight  
    Board's (CPOB), and the processes for submitting complaints and commendations.  
    This   plan   enhances   transparency   and   accountability   while   cultivating   strong,  
    collaborative relationships between the community and the Dallas Police Department  
    (DPD).  
       
    Community Outreach and Engagement Goals   
    The goals of our public participation efforts are to:   
       
         1)  Raise awareness about the OCPO and CPOB’s mission and purpose;   
        2)  Collect meaningful input from community members and stakeholders;   
        3)   Involve and consult communities who have been historically underserved and  
             underrepresented or subject to discrimination and police misconduct and;   
        4)  Build  trusting  relationships  with  the  public  and  seek  their  approval  of  the  
             strategies proposed in our plan.   
       
    This outreach plan outlines a comprehensive set of strategies and methods to achieve  
    our objectives while ensuring alignment with the structured process we will follow to  
    develop and implement the plan effectively.  
      
    Background    
      
    Following the tragic murder of Botham Jean by Dallas police officer Amber Guyger,  
    activists and members of the  civilian  review board  called on the city to establish an  
    independent  investigative  body.  They  advocated  for  a  properly  funded  and  staffed  
    entity   capable   of   conducting   thorough   reviews   of   citizen   complaints,   ensuring  
    transparency  and  recommending  restorative  policy.  In  April  20 19,  the  Dallas  City  
    Council  established  the  OCPO  through  Ordinance  No.  31192  under  Article  XXII,  
                                                                                                                  Page 2 of 13

Chapter  2  of  the  Dallas  City  Code.  Its  primary  purpose  is  to  provide  support  and  
technical assistance to the CPOB, formerly the Civilian Review Board. The OCPO aids  
the  CPOB  in  ensuring  that  complaints  against  DPD  officers  are  thoroughly  and  
impartially  investigated  through  independent  reviews and  investigations,  reinforcing  
accountability and public trust.   

Mission Statement   

The mission of the OCPO is to ensure civilian complaints are reviewed impartially to  
enhance  the  transparency  and  trust  between  the  City  of  Dallas,  the  Dallas  Police  
Department, and the community. To achieve its mission, the OCPO accepts complaints  
and  commendations  filed by members of the  public. A key function of the OCPO  is  
educating  community  members  on  police  complaint  procedures  and  processes  to  
empower  individuals  to  understand  their  rights  and  the  steps  involved  in  filing  
complaints against police officers. This educational component is essential in ensuring  
community  members  feel  heard  and  supported  when  raising  concerns  about  law  
enforcement  practices.  In  addition  to  educating  the  public,  the  OCPO  facilitates  a  
mediated  resolution  process between  complainants  and  Dallas  police  officers. This  
process allows for constructive dialogue and the potential for mutual understanding,  
addressing  concerns  to  promote  accountability  while  strengthening  relationships  
between officers and the community.   

The  OCPO  also  plays  a  crucial  role  in  overseeing  IAD  investigations  into  external  
administrative complaints. By ensuring these investigations are conducted thoroughly  
and  transparently,  the  office  helps  to  uphold  the  integrity  of  the  complaint  review  
process.  The  Director  of  the  OCPO  monitors  the  DPD’s  investigations  into  critical  
incidents involving Dallas police officers. These incidents, which may include officer- 
involved shootings or cases of serious misconduct, require independent oversight to  
ensure  impartiality  and  adherence  to  proper  investigative  procedures.  By  actively  
overseeing  these  investigations,  the  OCPO  reinforces  the  principles  of  justice  and  
transparency,  which  are  essential  for  maintaining  public  trust.  Through  its  various  
functions, the OCPO serves as a bridge between the community and law enforcement,  
ensuring that complaints and concerns are handled fairly and the policies governing  
police conduct reflect accountability and integrity.

Strategies and Methods   
   
Strategy 1: Networking  
  
Develop  a  comprehensive  list  of  key  stakeholders to  engage,  including  community  
members,  local  organizations,  civic  groups,  businesses,  and  representatives  from  
diverse  communities.  This  initiative  aims  to  form  strategic  alliances  with  local  
organizations, community leaders, and other stakeholders to enhance outreach efforts  
and broaden the influence of the civilian oversight body.    
   
Ongoing engagement and support from stakeholders regarding local public safety and  
law  enforcement  issues  are  crucial  for  the  oversight  body's  effectiveness.  While  
establishing and supporting civilian oversight may be politically advantageous during  
a crisis, sustained interest and support from stakeholders who value accountability,  
and transparency are essential for successful oversight. An oversight body’s ability to  
sustain  support  often  depends  on  the  effectiveness  of  its  outreach  efforts  to  key  
stakeholders.   
     
Our office will work to develop a citywide grassroots network infrastructure to enhance  
community engagement and coordinate outreach efforts. These networks will be vital  
for  organizing  virtual  town  halls,  in-person  meetings,  and  other  events  to  raise  
awareness. The OCPO Outreach Team will also create a database to collect contact  
information  from  community  organizations  and  track  outreach  activities  using  an  
engagement calendar for all 15 council districts.   

Strategy 2: Messaging and Marketing  
  
Maintain  clear  and  concise  messaging  that  explains  the  purpose  and  functions  of  
civilian oversight in an accessible and engaging manner across various media formats.  
The   communication   channels   to   reach   target   audiences   include   print,   video,  
community  newsletters,  social  media,  and  in-person  communications,  all  of  which  
should reflect the office's brand.   
   
We will create a brand toolkit for the OCPO to use in its outreach efforts. This toolkit  
will include social media  messaging templates and a social media campaign strategy  
aligned  with  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  for  various  platforms  to  measure  
engagement  effectively. A  Constant  Contact©  email  marketing  strategy  will  also  be  
developed to ensure consistent communication with key stakeholders and  facilitate  
press releases.

Strategy 3: Outreach and Engagement   
  
Establish fifteen outreach zones, each corresponding to one of the City of Dallas's 15  
Council  Districts.  This  initiative  aims  to  create  an  inclusive  outreach  plan  that  
addresses the needs of all community members, especially those from marginalized  
or  underserved  communities.  It  will  also  provide  opportunities  for residents  to  give  
feedback, share their concerns, and participate in the oversight process.    
   
Effective  civilian  oversight  relies  heavily  on  community  involvement.  Gathering  
feedback from the community and stakeholders is essential to shaping and refining the  
civilian  oversight  process,  ensuring  it  is  responsive  and  aligned  with  public  needs.  
Assessing the effectiveness of our office to determine which accountability issues to  
address,  ensures the development of a tailored system that meets the community’s  
needs  and  expectations. Active  participation  from  those  most  affected  by  local  law  
enforcement issues is essential for civilian oversight to achieve its goals.   
   
To facilitate this process, we will maintain a dedicated 24/7 hotline and organize regular  
community meetings.   
   
Strategy 4: Promote Transparency and Accountability  
  
Increase our  awareness  by strategically engaging the community,  local  businesses,  
and  organizations.  This  can  be  achieved  by  sharing  information  about  the  civilian  
oversight process, including investigations, complaint data, and recommendations. We  
aim  to  encourage  measurable  engagement  through  targeted  messaging  and  clear  
calls to action. To further enhance transparency, we will publish detailed reports, host  
public hearings, and provide regular updates on the oversight body's activities. This  
approach ensures continuous accountability and informed participation.   
  
To measure public input, we will utilize the following methods:    

     •    Public comment at meetings,   
     •    Responses via email and social media   
     •    Community Feedback from Complaint and Commendation Form Submissions   
     •    Calls received on a dedicated 24/7 hotline.   

                                                                                                                  Page 5 of 13

    Assessment of Outreach and Engagement   
       
    Community engagement is essential for building trusting relationships between citizens  
    and law enforcement. It is important to understand the community’s perception of law  
    enforcement, identify areas of concern, and  pinpoint specific needs related to police  
    accountability and transparency.   
       
    The outreach team will track and report on engagement activities, utilizing  surveys,  
    focus   groups,   public   meetings,   and   community   forums.   They   will   maintain   a  
    comprehensive   engagement  calendar  to  document  events,  facilitate   community  
    educational  presentations,  and  collect  stakeholder  feedback.  We  will  also  collect  
    measurable input from communities within these outreach zones, including reports of  
    officer  misconduct  and  commendations,  to  ensure  continuous  improvement.  To  
    facilitate tracking of community engagement across the 15 council districts, we will  
    utilize dynamic QR codes printed on outreach materials. Our outreach methods will  
    include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:   
       
          •    Conducting community meetings and providing educational presentations.  
          •    Connecting with local leaders and community-based organizations.   
          •    Making policy recommendations based on community feedback and complaint  
               data and providing district partners with marketing materials.   
          •    Facilitating efforts that align with the office's mission within the outreach zones.   
       
    Timeline for Implementation  
    
    The activities outlined in this Community Outreach and Engagement Plan will be

Phase 1 – Production/Awareness   
  
A  key  component  of  the  outreach  activities  involves  the  creation  of  informative  
materials for distribution and marketing.  Staff will develop materials for the OCPO to  
share with community-based organizations and other resources to inform the public  
about the OCPO. Another aspect of this phase includes the introduction of the Director  
of OCPO to communities, the rollout of a new OCPO webpage, videos, a social media  
presence, and a media campaign.  
  
Phase 2 - Educational Outreach   
  
This phase encompasses the OCPO’s educational campaign to inform  City of Dallas  
residents about the office’s role, the complaint process, opportunities for community  
participation, and the tools available for submitting input and feedback. The goal in this  
phase  is  to  reach  out  to  all  communities,  businesses,  and  organizations  while  
specifically targeting those communities that are discouraged to engage in the process.  
Additionally,  the  office  will  initiate  a  partnership  with  the  DPD  Academy  to  raise  
awareness of the OCPO and CPOB functions through presentations.   
  
The  OCPO  will  collaborate  with  statewide  and  local  non-profit  organizations  and  
businesses to form strategic partnerships to advance  this educational initiative. This  
initiative will launch in March, along with the rollout of targeted social media campaigns,  
intended to inform City of Dallas residents of the process and encourage participation  
in  Phase 3. The OCPO will host educational meetings across the 15 Outreach Zones  
the  office  defines.  The  office  is  also  dedicated  to  engaging  diverse  communities,  
ensuring accessibility for non-English-speaking populations.  Outreach print collateral  
will be available in the languages that align with the top 7 common languages in the  
City of Dallas.   
  
Phase 3 - Public Meetings for Public Input   
  
In this phase, the OCPO will focus on gathering public input through community forums  
scheduled  throughout  the  city.  The  OCPO  will  collaborate  with  community-based  
organizations to promote these events and facilitate feedback sessions. The OCPO  
and/or the community groups involved will lead these public forums.   
  
During this phase, a group of stakeholders will solicit input regarding both operational  
enhancements  and  initiatives aimed at building trust. The office will also utilize tools  
such as surveys and open discussions, referred to as communities of interest (COI),  
to collect feedback from the public. By the conclusion of this phase, we will have our  
present our initial set of metrics data. The primary objective of this phase is to improve  
transparency and empower the public by facilitating access to the resources provided  
by the Office of Community Police Oversight.
