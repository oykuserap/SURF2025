  MEETING SUMMARY  
    
 Chairwoman Puga provided a report of meetings and events that she attended with City  
 stakeholders on behalf of the Commission.  
   
 Vice Chairman Kalkanli provided a report on his discussion with the students at University of  
 Texas at Dallas and potential partnership with the Commission on Disabilities.  
   
 Chairwoman Puga opened the floor to sub-committees to make presentations.   
   
 Commissioner Shaw, District 12, introduced a possible partnership with a photographer by the  
  name Rick who has a nonprofit, called Positive Exposure, that will be putting on an art exhibit  
  next fall featuring people with disabilities.   
   
 Commissioner Revi, District 1, mentioned the work that her and Commissioner Olsen are doing  
 with transportation to provide reliable and efficient transportation in public and private sectors.   
   
 Chairwoman Puga requested if there were any other Commissioners interested in speaking.  
 Chairwoman Puga moved to the next order of business and introduced Blake Lindsay of Envision.  
 Chairwoman Puga shared Mr. Lindsay’s book of work with everyone at the last meeting, but since  
 technical difficulties interrupted, she was unable to go into more about the book.   
   
  Mr. Lindsay presented the Commission with the work being done at Envision Dallas including  
 details on the new facility location and programs being offered to people who are blind and with  
  low vision.  
   
Staff noticed that quorum was lost after Mr. Lindsay’s presentation and brought to the attention of  
Chairwoman Puga. The meeting was paused as staff and Chairwoman Puga attempted to  
reestablish quorum.   

    

  ADJOURNMENT  

  Due to quorum being lost, the September 26th Commission on Disabilities meeting was ended at  

  3:17 pm. Chairwoman Puga thanked guest and attendees for their time.
