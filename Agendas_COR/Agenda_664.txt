Protections under the Fair Housing Act 

The Fair Housing Act imposes an affirmative  
obligation to make housing available to  
people with disabilities.  
• Housing providers must make “reasonable  
 accommodations” and allow “reasonable  
 modifications” necessary to afford a person  
 with a disability equal opportunity to use and  
 enjoy a dwelling.   

                                                                 10

Reasonable Accommodation 

• A Reasonable Accommodation is a change in  
 "rules, policies, practices, or services" when such  
 allowed change may be necessary to afford  
 persons with disabilities equal opportunity to use  
 and enjoy a dwelling. 
• Applies to a buyer/renter who is disabled, a person  
 with a disability who will live in the dwelling and a  
 person who is associated with a person w/ disability,  
 such as a family member or caregiver. 

                                                                    11

 close to an accessible route for a tenant with a  
 mobility impairment when other tenants must park in  
 spaces on a first come, first served basis. 
• Extending rent payment deadlines past the  
 stipulated policy deadline.

conditions. Unlike service animals, ESAs are not  
trained to perform specific tasks or work related to a  
person’s disability. Instead, their primary role is to offer  
emotional stability and unconditional companionship  
to their handlers, helping to alleviate symptoms of  
emotional or mental disabilities. 

                                                                       13

Emotional Support Animals 

• No pet fees. 
• No certifications.   
• No breed or weight restrictions (without proof  
 of “direct threat” to health or safety). 
• Landlords can request verification of the need  
 for the service/assistance animal if the  
 resident's need is not "readily apparent". 

                                                                   14 

----------------------- Page 34-----------------------

When Requests can be Denied 

• Generally, an Accommodation is NOT  
 required if the housing provider would  
 experience an undue financial and  
 administrative burden and the  
 accommodation would represent a  
 fundamental alteration of their business  
 program.

Reasonable Modifications

an existing premise occupied by a person with  
a disability. Reasonable Modifications can

exteriors of a unit, as well as common areas. 

                                                                 16 

----------------------- Page 36-----------------------

Examples of Reasonable Modifications 

• Installation of alternative storage that is  
 reachable, such as storage with pull out  
 drawers/shelves or in an accessible location. 
• Removal of carpet and installation of  
 appropriate flooring to make it more  
 maneuverable for a wheelchair or walker . 
• Installation of visual alerts for doorbells, alarms,  
 or other systems.

Overarching Key Themes: Community Feedback 

                                           Community members who experience the  
                                     1     greatest disparities desire the opportunity to  
                                           participate in and contribute towards our city's  
                                           tremendous, shared prosperity. 

                                           There is a clear community appetite for more  
                                     2     progress and fewer plans. Residents are  
                                           cautiously optimistic that department-level equity  
                                           progress measures provide an avenue for greater  
                                           government accountability and leadership.

Economic, Community & Workforce Development 

        Become       the   most    economically      inclusive    City   by   eliminating    the   wealth    gap 
        through workforce and economic inclusion, fostering full participation in cultural and civic 
        life of  Dallas by acknowledging contributions of historically disadvantaged communities, 
        and investing in economic and human development in equity priority areas. 

         Example Action Target 1.2: 
         •  Increased procurement accessibility by building a pipeline of  
            diverse contractors, vendors, and suppliers to increase  
            economic stability and workforce development. 

         Example Department Progress Measure OEI.5: 
          • Increase the percent of ADA service requests in  
            historically disadvantaged communities completed within  
            Service Level Agreement to 85% by October 2024.
