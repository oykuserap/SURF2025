ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION MEETING MINUTES  
November 8, 2023  

BRIEFING ITEMS  
  
I)   ForwardDallas  Comprehensive  Land  Use  Plan  Update:   Environmental  Justice  Briefing  +  
     Workshop  
     [ForwardDallas Project Team, Planning + Urban Design]  
     Attachment: Presentation (see agenda)  
     a)   The Commission was briefed on progress of the updated draft ForwardDallas plan, including  
          its environmental justice components. Commissioners previously discussed with Planning +  
          Urban  Design  staff  the   idea  of  an   Environmental Justice  Overlay  that   would  create  
          additional considerations and requirements for land uses, permits, development plans, land  
          clearing,   allocation  of   resources,   and   notification  to             community   stakeholders.  The  
          Commission discussed the new Area of Focus designation to determine if it will accomplish  
          the  same  goals.   Discussion also centered  around  how  consideration is  being  given  to  
          community-led vision plans created out of self-determination and how authorized hearings  
          are being incorporated into the draft plan. Finally, the Commission discussed the timeline  
          for updating development and zoning codes  after the adoption of the ForwardDallas plan  
          and what the public engagement component will include.  
                 
II)   Comprehensive Environmental & Climate Action Plan (CECAP) Annual Report  
     [Carlos  Evans,  Director, Office  of  Environmental  Quality &  Sustainability;  Paul  White  II, Assistant  
     Director   (I),   Office  of   Environmental       Quality   &   Sustainability;     Rosaerlinda      Cisneros,    Climate  
     Coordinator, Office of Environmental Quality & Sustainability]  
     Attachment: Presentation (see agenda)  
     a)   The  Commission was briefed  on  the  CECAP progress report for FY23 and the CECAP  
          Implementation Work Plan for FY24.    
     b)   Questions/Comments  
          i)   Commissioner Wallace  
               (1)  Please follow up with more information on the Mill Creek tunnel.  
               (2)  Please follow up on  percent of  recyclables that are  actually being  recycled (not  
                    necessarily the contamination rate, though that would be good to know too, but are  
                    recyclable items actually being recycled?).  
               (3)  Please follow up with the Forestry Task Force regarding if the tree fund can be used  
                    for Texas Tree Foundation tree planting projects, as they are $16,000 short.  
          ii)  Chair Bazan  
               (1)  Please come back in the future with a Dallas Community Air Management Program  
                    (D-CAMP) update. Also suggest holding more public meetings on this topic.

     TO  Honorable Chair Bazan and Members of the Environmental Commission                                                 

SUBJECT  2023 Equity Indicators Report: Environmental Justice Measures Update  
           
         On June 14, 2023, the Environmental Commission received a memo SUBJECT: 2023  
         Equity  Indicators  Report  Update  and  Environmental  Justice  Indicators.  The  Office  of  
         Environmental  Quality  and  Sustainability  (OEQS)  engaged  the  EVC  Environmental  
         Justice   Subcommittee   to   solicit   recommendations   for   new   environmental   equity  
         indicators. The Offices of Environmental Quality and Sustainability, Equity and Inclusion,  
         and  EveryTexan  have  been  working  on  finalizing  the  2023  Equity  Indicators  Report.  
         Consistent with feedback from the mentioned recommendations, residents, community  
         partners and the Environmental Commission feedback, the updated report now includes  
         a sixth theme - Environmental Justice.  
           
         As  the  City  of  Dallas  continues  to  center  equity,  it  is  critical  to  note  the  ways  that  
         Historically  Disadvantaged  Communities  (HDCs)  and  Equity  Priority  Areas have been  
         disproportionately  impacted  by environmental  injustices.  Through collaborative  efforts,  
         the 2023 Equity Indicators Report has leveraged both formal and informal feedback to  
         support  in  identifying  the  Environmental  Justice  Indicators-  Screening  Tool,  Canopy  
         Coverage, Energy Efficiency, and Healthy Food.  
           
         To underscore the importance of monitoring and addressing environmental issues, each  
         of  the  indicators,  in  the  2023  report  also  aligns  with  Comprehensive  Environmental  
         Climate Action Plan (CECAP) Action Items. This alignment demonstrates a cohesive and  
         effective framework for tackling environmental concerns as well as increasing consistency  
         and promoting internal collaboration.  
           
         Equity Indicators Methodology and Analysis  
           
         The selected vendor, EveryTexan, uses the City University of New York Institute for State  
         and Local Governance (CUNY ISGL)  Methodology to analyze and generate the Equity  
         Indicators report. CUNY ISGL  Methodology is an adaptable approach to creating Equity  
         Indicator tools for cities that want to measure and improve equity in local communities.  
         Equity  Indicators  are  a  set  of  metrics  that  capture  the  extent  of  disparities  faced  by  
         different  groups  across  various  domains,  such  as  economic  opportunity,  education,  
         neighborhood            and      infrastructure,         public      health,       justice     and      government,           and  
         environmental justice.

U.S. Global Change Research Program 

 The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was  
 mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act of  
 1990 (P.L. 101-606), “to assist the Nation and the world to  
 understand, assess, predict and respond to human-induced  
 and natural process of global change.”

National Climate Assessment (NCA) Basics 

  •   Evaluates a wide range of scientific and technical inputs  
      from diverse and authoritative sources. Applies best  
      expert judgment to characterize certainty. 
  •   Relevant for policy and decision-making but does not  
      prescribe specific policy interventions or advocate for a  
      particular viewpoint. 
  •   Assesses a range of potential impacts, helping decision- 
      makers better identify risks that could be avoided or  
      reduced. 
  •   Fully compliant with the Global Change Research Act  
      (GCRA) and other applicable laws and policies. 
  •   Provides multiple opportunities for public engagement. 
  •   Employs an extensive review process.

  Some neighborhoods and communities in the region are suffering disproportionately from climate- 
  related hazards  because of long-standing marginalization, discrimination, and governmental policies.  

   As a result, climate change

            Main Takeaways for SGP Region 

•   Actions have been too slow in pace, and investments have been  
    inadequate in scale and scope, compared to what is needed to minimize  
    strongly negative consequences of climate change by midcentury. 
•   Transformative adaptation and climate equity/justice provide holistic  
    frameworks for climate adaptation actions.  
•   Many actions that enhance the resilience of public services and  
    infrastructure also are expected to reduce future financial costs from  
    extreme events.

SUBJECT   Implementation  Subcommittee  Recommendations  on Adoption  of SolarAPP+  
            
          Background  
            
          In  2021,  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  launched  a  collaborative  
          effort with key code officials, authorities  having jurisdiction  (AHJs), and the solar industry  
          to  develop   standardized  plan  review  software  that  can  run  compliance  checks  and  
          process building  permit approvals  for eligible  rooftop solar systems.  

               •    Integrates with existing government software.  
               •    Automates  plan review, permit approval, and project tracking.  
               •    Standardizes up to 90% of standard system  plans.  
               •    Provides inspection checklist and final sign-off after installation.  
            
          View this video to see how SolarAPP+ is benefitting  communities:  
          https://youtu.be/xKhX_UAT8YQ.  
            
          NREL conducted a control trial pilot to validate  SolarAPP+ performance, as used by  
          AHJs with diverse characteristics and needs. Highlights  of key findings include:    
             
               •    Pilot AHJs collectively  spent 383 hours on SolarAPP+ implementation and saved  
                    236 hours on permit and revision review during the pilot.    
               •    By providing  instantaneous review, the SolarAPP+ reduced the average  permit  
                    review time to less than one day across all five AHJs.    
               •    Participating  contractors required training  on how to use the application  
                    efficiently.    
               •    Inspection  passage rates for SolarAPP+ projects were comparable to traditionally  
                    permitted projects, with nominal impacts on inspection duration.    
               •    Projects submitted through SolarAPP+ were installed and inspected on average  
                    12 days faster than projects using the traditional  process (Figure ES-  1). – NREL

   PAGE       2 of 2  

               
             Recommendation  
               
             The   Implementation              Subcommittee   requests   that   the   Environmental                           Commission  
             approve  a recommendation  to  the  Parks,  Trails  &  the  Environment  Committee  of  the  
             Dallas City Council, for  immediate implementation of the SolarAPP+ developed  by  NREL  
             for the following reasons:  
               
                   1.  NO COST to municipalities  
                             a.  Implemented  quickly  
                             b.  Free training for city employees by  NREL  
                             c.   Saves city employees’ time  
                             d.  Reduces burden on IT department since it is cloud-based  
                  2.  An area of relief for the solar permitting in Dallas by streamlining the process for:  
                             a.  City staff  
                             b.  Homeowners and businesses wanting to install solar  
                             c.   Solar installation  contractors  
                   3.  SolarAPP+ significantly  reduces the soft costs of solar installation  including  
                        permitting, inspections and interconnect.  
                  4.  Proposed annual  license requiring  solar installers to submit new applications  
                       each year, ensuring compliance with Texas Solar Energy Society’s Code of  
                        Ethics and addressing any pending  or unresolved  projects. Companies failing to  
                       address existing installation  issue or customer complaints would be temporarily  
                        barred from initiating  new projects until issues are appropriately  resolved.
