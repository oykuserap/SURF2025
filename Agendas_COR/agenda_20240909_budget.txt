 Background/History  

  
• Before ELDT, employees were on their own.  

             •  No formal training program was required.  

             •  Employees could practice on the equipment, if there was time.  

             •  Employees scheduled with DMV when they were ready to test.  

             •  Failed probation if CDL was not obtained within six months.

 Background/History  

  
• The Impact of ELDT  Regulations  
          •  Options included  (1) hiring only employees with a CDL,  (2) hiring outside  
               vendors, or (3) creating our own ELDT program  
          •  Option one would provide us with little to no opportunity to compete in  
               the marketplace for drivers with CDL license  
          •  Option two provides significant logistical and funding challenges to  
               address the shortage/turnover of drivers with a CDL license  
          •  Option three is what was chosen, and we have an outstanding support  
               team in our Street Operations division that:  
                    •  Researched the requirements  
                    •  Completed the application process  
                    •  Registered us as a private training provider for the City of Dallas

          Priorities / Update  
  
         As  the  City  of  Dallas  continues  preparation  for  the  89th  Texas Legislature  and  119th  
          Congress, both set to convene in 2025, the Workforce, Education and Equity Committee  
         worked  with  the  Office  of  Government  Affairs  and  stakeholders  to  develop  the  City’s  
          legislative programs for consideration.  
  
          The Workforce, Education and Equity Committee agenda included a discussion of state  
          and federal legislative priorities on December 11, 2023 and June 10, 2024.  
  
         At the request of the Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee of Legislative Affairs, a memo dated

         SUMMARY  
  
         The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) provides grant funds  
         through the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (“HOPWA”) Program, to assist  
         grantees in meeting the housing needs of low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and HIV-  
         related illness and their families within the grantee’s Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area  
         (“EMSA”).  Grant funding under the HOPWA Program (“HOPWA Grant”) is part of the  
         City’s HUD Consolidated Plan Budget. The Dallas EMSA includes seven counties:  Collin,  
         Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, and Rockwall Counties.  
  
         As the local grantee of HOPWA funds, the City of Dallas delivers a comprehensive set of  
         housing support services to eligible residents through a combination of the Fresh Start  
         Housing   Program   and   its   Community   Centers,   as   well   as   through   subrecipient  
         agreements with nonprofit organizations selected through a competitive bidding process  
         and  an  Interlocal  Agreement  with  Dallas  County  Health  &  Human  Services.   Prior  to  
         FY2022-23, HOPWA subrecipient agreements were administered through the Office of  

                                                                 “Our Product is Service”

            Homeless        Solutions       (“OHS”).      Beginning       with    FY2022-23,         HOPWA         subrecipient  
            agreements  were  transitioned  to  the  Office  of  Community  Care  (“OCC”)  in  order  to  
            consolidate the HOPWA Program under one department.  
  
            This agenda item authorizes the second of two one-year renewal options funded under  
            the  FY  2024-25  HOPWA  Grant.  This  renewal  option  includes  a  small  increase  in  the  
            amount of $413,825.00 to enable the agencies to provide additional assistance under the  
            HOPWA  Program,  consisting  of:  (1)  Emergency/Tenant  Based  Rental  Assistance;  (2)  
            Facility  Based  Housing,  Master  Leasing,  and  Emergency  Vouchers;  (3)  Housing  
            Placement and Other Support Services; (4) Housing Facilities Rehabilitation/Repair; and  
            (5)   Housing   Information   Services   for   persons   living   with   HIV/AIDS   (collectively,  
            “Programs”).  These Programs are funded under the HOPWA Grant from HUD.  
  
            BACKGROUND  

            In  order  to  identify  subrecipients,  on  March  3,  2022, the  City’s  Office  of Procurement  
            Services  (”OPS”)  issued  a  Request  for  Competitive  Sealed  Proposals  (“RFCSP”)  
            (#BRZ22-00018719) for OHS for HOPWA programs, providing assistance for low-income  
            persons living with HIV/AIDS in the Dallas EMSA.  The solicitation closed on April 8, 2022.  

            In response to the RFCSP, all proposers were recommended for award, but funding was  
            not sufficient, in all cases, to cover the full amount requested by proposers.  
  
            On February 22, 2023, the City Council authorized one-year service contracts, with two  
            one-year  renewal  options  contingent  on  available  funding,  with  a  term  beginning  on  
            October 1, 2022, with multiple providers and OCC took over administration of the FY2022-  
            23 HOPWA contracts once they were executed.  
  
            Due  to  a  substantial  increase  in  the  national  HOPWA  Grant  appropriation,  the  City’s  
            HOPWA Grant increased by over $1 million, which provided additional capacity to fund  
            renewal  contracts  at  levels  not  available  under  the  initial  award.  The  renewal  option  
            includes an increase in the amount of $413,825.00 to enable the agencies to provide  
            additional assistance under the HOPWA Program as shown below.  
  
            Funding  increases  were  applied  across  all  projects  to  cover  increased  costs  of  doing  
            business,       including      staff    salary     and     benefits,      occupancy,        utilities,    insurance,  
            maintenance, and  other  costs.  Emergency/Tenant Based  Rental Assistance,  Housing  
            Placement,  and  Master  Leasing  activities   are  receiving  funding  increases  to  sustain  
            housing  rent  subsidies  in  the  face  of  higher  market  rental  rates  and  higher  utility  
            assistance needed by eligible residents.  For these projects, the funding increases will  
            help expand the number of residents served (within current staffing capacities).  Other  
            projects, like Facility Based Housing, are physically not able to expand their number of  
            housing units or persons served, but they have experienced increased operating costs  
            and are therefore also receiving increased funds in the renewal.  

                                                                “Our Product is Service”  
  
                                                     Empathy | Ethics | Excellence | Engagement | Equity                                       50

         Services Program Fund  
  
         Background  
         This item represents the acceptance of $250,000.00 in additional funding for the Texas  
         Department  of  Criminal  Justice  contract  to  support  re-entry  services  for  the  period  of  
         September  1, 2024, through August 31, 2025. On June 26, 2024, Council authorized the  
         extension of the Interlocal Agreement and acceptance of funding for FY25 and additional  
         funding. This item represents additional added funding for FY25 programming.  
  
         The Reentry Services Program was established by the Texas State Legislature to support  
         projects in Dallas and Houston that strive to support individuals being release from TDCJ  
         facilities and returning to the Dallas or Houston area. This project has been supported  
         through appropriations in the 84th, 86th, 87th, and now the 88th Texas State Legislative  
         Session in 2023. Funding was once again appropriated within the budget for the Texas  
         Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to enter into an agreement with the City of Dallas  
         to establish and operate a program for reentry services to individuals released from TDCJ  
         facilities  who  are  returning  to  the  Dallas  area.  The  City  of  Dallas  may  enter  into  
         agreements with non-profit entities, faith-based organizations, community groups and the  
         private sector for the provision of services.

         Community Care for the Purchase of Garden Box Kits  
  
  
         On  August  14,  2024,  the  following  Office  of  Community  Care  agenda  item  will  be  
         considered by City Council:  
  
         File ID: 24-2204: Authorize an eighteen-month service contract for the distribution of in-  
         home garden kits to provide residents with a recurring supply of fresh grown produce for  
         the Office of Community Care  -  Bellcam Group, most advantageous proposer of four -  
         Not to exceed $200,000.00 -  Financing: ARPA Redevelopment Fund (subject to annual  
         appropriations)  
  
         Background  
         This  item  authorizes  a  contract  for  the  purchase  of  garden  box  kits  for  distribution  to  
         residents  in  targeted  communities.  Residents  will  be  able  to  submit  an  application  to  
         receive a garden box kit delivered to their home with sufficient materials to grow produce  
         for  6  months.  This  project  is  supported  by  ARPA  Redevelopment  Fund,  previously  
         Coronavirus State and Federal Fiscal Recovery Funds. The Garden Box Kit project aims  
         to impact food insecurity and promote healthy food consumption by creating a consistent  
         source of supplemental produce in the home.  
  
         The Garden Box Kit project was piloted in 2021 as a part of the City’s initial pandemic  
         response  programs.  The  project  was  well-received  and  distributed  garden  box  kits  to  
         more than 200 households in communities determined at highest risk, including those  
        with higher caseloads, with higher concentrations of older adults and zip codes identified  
         by reviewing the Community Health Needs Assessment. The cost per Garden Box Kit,  
         ranges between $106 and $181 depending on size, includes all fees, with the vendor  
         responsible for direct mailing or delivery to the client. The program distributed in-home  
         garden kits to provide residents with a recurring supply of fresh grown produce, shipped  
         via contactless delivery. Our goal is to serve approximately 250 to 500 residents over 2  
         to 3 phases, depending on demand and the number of applications received, ultimately  
         reaching between 500 and 1,000 residents. According to the program evaluation, more  
         than 90% of recipients said the garden kit was easy or very easy to set up and more than  
         half  stated  having  no  experience  with  gardening.  The  top  benefits  of  the  program,  
         according  to  respondents,  were  direct  food  access  (88%),  nutritious  meals  (77%),  
         ongoing supply of produce (74%), learning a new skill (71%), helping with mental wellness  
         (63%), and spending less on expensive grocery items like produce (62%).

SUBJECT  

                Office of Community Care for the Purchase of Garden Box Kits  
  
               For this project, we sought garden box kits that are easy to set up and require minimal  
               space  so  that  individuals  with  little  to  know  gardening  experience  would  be  able  to  
               participate. The vendor was identified via a formal procurement process managed by the  
               Office of Procurement Services using a Request for Bids model. A total of 4 responses  
               were received and the contract is being awarded to the lowest bidder.

SUBJECT  Agreement with Dallas County to Provide Housing Assistance for Persons with  
          HIV/AIDS  

         On August 28, 2024, the following Office of Community Care item will be considered by  
         City Council:  
  
         Item 24-2170:  Authorize an Interlocal Agreement in the amount of $2,824,600.00 with  
         Dallas  County  on  behalf  of  Dallas  County  Health  and  Human  Services  to  provide  
         scattered site housing assistance for persons with HIV/AIDS for the  period October 1,  
         2024  through  September  30,  2025  -  Not  to  exceed  $2,824,600.00  -  Financing:  U.S.  
         Department of Housing and Urban Development Housing Opportunities for Persons with  
         AIDS Grant Funds  

         Background  
  
         This agenda item authorizes an ILA with Dallas County Health and Human Services to  
         continue providing a HOPWA short-term rent, mortgage, and utility program and long-  
         term tenant based rental assistance program, including associated administrative costs.  
         Because HOPWA Grant Funds may be expended for eligible purposes within three years  
         of  HUD’s  award,  remaining  FY  2022-23  funds  are  included  in  this  year’s  Interlocal  
         Agreement (“ILA”) with Dallas County Health and Human Services.  
  
         This ILA was funded by FY 2023-24 HOPWA Grant Funds which was available beginning  
         October  1, 2023 and was  contingent upon HU  D's  approval of the  City's  FY  2023-24  
         Action  Plan,  and  execution  of  grant  agreements  with  HUD,  and  unspent  FY  2022-23  
         HOPWA Grant Funds.  
  
         Dallas   County   Health               and   Human   Services   has   a   long-established   history   of  
         administering  HOPWA  program  funds,  with  the  organizational  capacity  to  continue  
         providing  scattered  site  housing  assistance  to  eligible  persons  without  disruption,  
         including a full-time HOPWA manager, three full-time HOPWA caseworkers, and a full-  
         time HOPWA clerk, all provided through HOPWA funding. In addition, the County is the  
         administrative  agency  for  other  local  area  organizations  eligible  for  HIV/AIDS  grant  
         funding  and,  as  such,  has  collaborative  relationships  with  HIV/AIDS  service  providers  
         across the Dallas Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area. For these reasons, Dallas County  
         Health and Human Services is recommended for funding to continue providing scattered  
         site housing assistance services to eligible persons residing primarily in Dallas County.  
         To ensure eligible persons across the Dallas Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area have  

                                                                    “Our Product is Service”

              access to the full continuum of HOPWA eligible activities, the City intends to enter into  
              additional  project  sponsor  agreements  with  entities  that  provide  additional  eligible  
              activities (e.g., facility-based housing, housing information services, housing placement,  
              and  support  services)  or  that  provide  scattered  site  housing  assistance  to  eligible  
              individuals outside of Dallas County. Dallas County Health and Human Services expects  
             to serve 310 households annually through this agreement.  
  
  
              Since approximately 1993, through ILAs with the City of Dallas, Dallas County Health and  
              Human Services has provided HOPWA scattered site housing assistance, comprised of  
             Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (“TBRA”), Short-Term Rent/Mortgage/Utility (“STRMU”)  
              Emergency Assistance, supportive services, and administrative costs, to eligible persons  
              primarily residing in Dallas County.  

             The TBRA Program includes long-term rental assistance (with a utility allowance) that an  
              eligible person may use at a housing unit of his or her choice. This assistance is portable,  
              and moves with the client, similar to the Housing Choice Voucher program, within the  
              Dallas  Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area. STRMU  Emergency Assistance is designed  
             to prevent homelessness, and includes short-term rent, mortgage, and utility payments  
             for up to 21 weeks in any 52-week period. HOPWA clients receiving scattered site housing  
              assistance also receive housing support services through case managers, who ensure  
             that clients have access to other services, such as medical care, transportation, legal  
             services, and food pantry.

         On  August  14,  2024,  the  following  Office  of  Community  Care  agenda  item  will  be  
         considered by City Council:  

         File ID: 24-2301: Authorize the (1) acceptance of a grant from Texas Department of State  
         Health Services for the Texas Lactation Support After-Hours Hotline Grant (Contract No.  
         HHS001465500001) in the amount of $400,000.00 to fund after-hours lactation support

        to August 31, 2025; (2)  receipt and deposit of grant funds in the Texas Lactation Support

         conditions, and documents required by the agreement, approved as to form by the City  
        Attorney –  Not to exceed $400,000.00 –  Financing FY25 Texas  Lactation Support After-  
         Hours Hotline Fund  
  
         Background  
         This item authorizes the acceptance of $400,000.00 to manage and support the Texas  
         Lactation  Support  After-Hours  Hotline  (TLSAH).  The  TSLAH  is  a  no-fee  assistance  
         service for lactating mothers to receive assistance and support. TSLAH services include  
         after-hours  lactation  support,  triage,  referral,  resource  sharing  and  the  provision  of  
         general and clinical breastfeeding information through telephone counseling provided by  
         International Board-Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs). Services can be offered in  
         multiple languages.  
  
         This  type  of  lactation  support  is  widely  accepted  as  an  effective  strategy  to  promote  
         positive  health  outcomes  for  both  mothers  and  their  babies.  The  purpose  of  this  
         partnership is to provide high-quality access to after-  hour support services in order to  
         address common barriers to breastfeeding and to promote higher breastfeeding rates and  
         exclusivity, over longer periods of time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and  
         Prevention’s most recent Breastfeeding Report Card, 85.9% of Texas babies born in 2017  
        were ever breastfed. However, that rate significantly declines to 55.1% at 6 months and  
         31.3%  at  12  months.  Additionally,  the  number  of  Breastfed  infants  receiving  formula  
         before 2 days of age is 22.5%, almost a quarter of the population (CDC 2020). Data from  

                                                               “Our Product is Service”

SUBJECT         from Texas Department of State Health Services for the Texas  
                Lactation Support After-Hours Hotline  

               Pacify,  an  established  provider  of  these  services,  shows  that  this  type  of  support  
               contributes to a 13% increase in prenatal visits and a 23% increase in postpartum care.  
  
               The funding awarded will enable the Dallas WIC program to enter an agreement with a  
               vendor  to  provide  these  services,  which  serve  as  a  compliment  to  lactation  and  
               breastfeeding  support  services  that  are  provided  in  WIC  clinics,  thus  making  this  
               important support available and accessible 24-hours per day, 7 days per week.

         Memorandum  
  
  
  

  
   DATE  September 6, 2024                                                                         CITY OF DALLAS  

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Workforce, Education, and Equity Committee  

SUBJECT  Office of Equity and Inclusion – Human Rights Workshop Update  
  
        Background:  

        This memo provides an update on the progress of the human rights workshop led by the  
        Office of Equity and Inclusion. The Workforce, Education, and Equity (WEE) Committee  
        proposed this workshop on June 10, 2024, following a presentation by OEI on research  
        related to the potential creation of a formal Human Rights Commission for the City of  
        Dallas. This proposal built upon an earlier memo to WEE dated February 12, 2024,  
        which outlined a preliminary approach for structuring a Human Rights Commission,  
        drawing on FIFA’s draft Human Rights Framework for the 2026 World Cup host cities at  
        that time.  The June 2024 research included engagement with the Disabilities and  
        Veteran Affairs Commission, and 18 other U.S. cities to gather best practices for the  
        City of Dallas. The WEE Committee acknowledged the necessity of involving additional  
        stakeholders and existing City commissions. Discussions focused on forming a  
        community-based task force, and OEI will host a human rights workshop to identify  
        relevant issues and strategies.  
  
        Partnering with the Dallas Sports Commission:  
        OEI acknowledged the significance of collaborating with the Dallas Sports Commission  
        to align with FIFA World Cup standards, which are informed largely by the UN’s Guiding  
        Principles on Business and Human Rights as the global human rights standard for  
        businesses FIFA has adapted for host cities in light of local governments’ role as a duty  
        bearer to protect human rights. Being able to integrate the proposed workshop with the  
        stakeholder engagement required for Dallas, as one of the 16 host cities for the 2026  
        World Cup. OEI has engaged the Executive Director of the Dallas Sports Commission  
        to explore this collaboration, with discussions informed by FIFA’s final Human Rights  
        Framework, released publicly on July 24, 2024. This Framework focuses on three main  
        pillars covering a range of human rights areas:  
           I.    Inclusion and Safeguarding: Focusing on both protecting vulnerable populations  
                 and ensuring a welcoming environment for all individuals.  
          II.    Worker’s  Rights:  Focusing  on  uplifting  workers  and  encouraging  just  working  
                 conditions.  
         III.    Access  to  Remedy:  Ensuring  any  human  rights  issues  are  referred  to  the  
                 appropriate government agency or existing civil society organization for follow-up.  

                                                             “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                      Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                              119

   PAGE      2 of 2  

  
             The Dallas Sports Commission welcomed the alignment efforts, with future  
             collaborations aimed at addressing human rights issues relevant to the City of Dallas in  
             2026. Key focus areas will include immigrants and refugees, accessibility,  
             homelessness, human trafficking, and other pressing concerns. This will involve working  
             closely with existing City of Dallas contacts for these specific areas. For World Cup  
             efforts that are directly linked to hosting, such as the International Broadcast Center,  
             Fan Fest, and other venues under the Host Committee purview, the Dallas Sports  
             Commission will separately engage a consultant to lead.  

             Plans to Structure Stakeholder Engagement for Workshop and Next Steps  
             Several streams of work have been identified to host the workshop in November 2024.  
             Staff will leverage the Dallas Sports Commission’s existing World Cup partner list  
             encompassing over 120 stakeholders previously engaged by the City during the bid  
             process.  Please find outlined phases below:  
                I.     Briefing the Planning Committee on progress to date and receiving direction and  
                       advice on preliminary plans before proceeding.  
               II.     Conducting a landscape assessment based on human rights areas identified by  
                       WEE crossed with human rights areas included in FIFA’s Framework.  
              III.     Designing and holding the workshop with pre-activities and facilitators to achieve  
                       the best possible consensus on the unique issues to address after de-duplicating  
                       with existing City efforts already in place.  
              IV.      Synthesizing stakeholder input, identifying potential strategies, and socializing  
                       results with the Planning Committee and stakeholders before finalizing actionable  
                       strategies.  
             The next step is for OEI to meet with stakeholders identified by WEE during the June  
             10, 2024, committee meeting by October. Staff are currently on track to finalize the  
             human rights strategies by the end of December 2024. If you have any questions,  
             please contact, Dr. Lindsey Wilson, Director of Equity and Inclusion at

SUBJECT  Dallas Youth Commission Update on Youth Civic Awareness Week  
  
         In light of the recent transition of Youth Commission and youth programming to the Office  
         of Community Care, OCC is pleased to provide an update on the recent Dallas Youth  
         Commission (YC) Youth Civic Awareness Week activities. During the week of August  
         26th , 2024, the City’s Youth Commission engaged in Youth Civic Awareness Week by  
         focusing on expanding its outreach and raising awareness among local students about  
         the importance of civic engagement. One of the key initiatives involved engaging with  
         students  at  local  football  games.  We  are  excited  to  report  that  these  engagements  
         enabled Youth Commissioners to successfully connect with approximately 576 students  
         at the following stadiums:  
  

             •    Forester Athletic Complex                                      •   Sprague Athletic Complex  
                  8233 Military Pkwy.                                                3701 Boulder Drive  
                  Dallas, TX 75227                                                   Dallas, TX 75233  
             •    Franklin Stadium                                               •   Jesse Owens Memorial Complex  
                  7017 Lakehurst Avenue                                              9191 S. Polk Street  
                  Dallas, TX 75230                                                   Dallas, TX 75232  
             •    Prentiss Harper Seagoville                                     •   Pleasant Grove Stadium  
                  Stadium                                                            8228 Maddox Street  
                  819 Jack Street                                                    Dallas, TX 75217  
                  Dallas, TX 75253  
  
         These interactions allowed Commissioners to inform young people about the City Youth  
         Commission's   mission,   the  opportunities   available   for   their   involvement,  and   the  
         importance   of  their  voice   in   shaping   the   future   of   our   city.  The   response   was  
         overwhelmingly positive, and we believe these efforts have significantly contributed to  
         increasing awareness and interest in the Youth Commission’s work. The Commissioners  
         are currently in the process of gathering feedback from these interactions and will use the  
         insights to inform future outreach strategies.  
  
         Thank you for your continued support of our initiatives. We look forward to discussing  
         these developments further and exploring additional opportunities to engage youth in civic  
         activities. Please feel free to contact me or Jessica Galleshaw, Director of the Office of  
         Community Care, if you have any questions or should you require additional information.  
  
         Sincerely,

                                                         Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                   123

        Background  

        Collectively, these items make up the City’s Early Childhood and Out of School Time  
        Services  (ECOSTS)  program  by  establishing  contracts  with  providers  for  subsidized  
        clients and target populations. The City’s childcare program has been in existence since  
        the  1980s.  This  program  has  served  thousands  of  low-moderate-income  families,  by  
        providing financial assistance by way of subsidy payments to their childcare provider and  
        contracting  with  local  nonprofit  agencies  to  provide  childcare  assistance  to  homeless  
        families and children with special needs. The ECOSTS Program is funded out of the HUD  
        Consolidated Plan Budget for U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Grant  

                                                             “Service First, Now!”

                                                                                                                                        126

            Funds. Through the ECOSTS Program, administered by the Office of Community Care,  
           the    program       promotes       stability    for   low-to-moderate-income             families     within    two  
           components of the program:  
  
            1. ECOSTS  Providers Program – Assist working parents and teen parents who are full-  
           time high school students, by reducing the cost of childcare to enable them to strive for  
           self-sufficiency.  Through this program, parents are able to choose their own childcare  
           provider.  The provider has to be fully-licensed, located in the City of Dallas, and must  
           become a vendor with the City.  
  
           The ECOSTS Program pays (see subsidy amount below) per week, per child, directly to  
           contracted childcare providers for childcare services for working parents whose income  
           falls in the low-to-moderate-income range of HUD Area Median Income (AMI) eligibility.

              On August 12, 2024, the Office of Community Care brought forward an item for the  
              purchase of Garden Box Kits for discussion at the Workforce, Education and Equity  
              Committee, which was to be discussed at Council that week. Based on feedback, it  
              became evident that there is limited support for the project. The Office of Community  
              Care is canceling the pending procurement process.
