Bumping into a conflict:                                          § 12A-24  

• If a conflict arises                  recuse yourself: 
      •  From the time of recognit                      ion, 
      •  Immediately refrain from participation, 
      •  Promptly disclose to the city secretary  and ….  

      PRO TIP: A person can only recuse if there  is a conflict. If there  
      is  the  appearance  of  a  conflict,  then  the  person  needs  to  
      consider   if  disclosure   makes  the  most  sense  and  perhaps  
      finding another way to handle the matter that does not  have the  
      appearance issue.

Gifts and Donations   

 Both are defined as  

  1.  a voluntary transfer of property or the conferral of a benefit, 

 2.   with  no equal or greater value received in return (§12A-2( 15) and (19)). 

                                                                                                                        51

What's the Difference?  

• Gifts are made to employees or officials.  

• Donations are made to the city through employees  
  or officials.  

                                                                          52

Options with Gifts  

Three options:  
1. Accept;   
2.  Refuse; or   
3.  Receive and donate (§12A-12(a)(5).  

Note: This is not a recusal situation. Either you can accept the  
gift,  or  you  cannot. You  cannot  accept  a  prohibited  gift  and  
deal with it by following the recusal process.  

                                                                               53

When Is a Gift Prohibited?                       - §12A-12(a)  

The general rule is that a gift is prohibited when it:  

1. Reasonably   tends   to              influence   or   reward   official 
    conduct; or 

2. The  city  official  or  employee  knows  it  is  intended  to 
    influence or reward the discharge of official duties. 

                                                                               54  

----------------------- Page 63-----------------------

Is there more guidance?  

YES, the Code sets out specific elements to help with          
the following:  

       1. Recognitions such as honorariums, public awards, and   
            ceremonial/protocol gifts;  
      2.  Meals, travel, lodging, and entertainment;  
      3.  Tickets;  
      4.  Relation based gifts (relatives, friends, etc.); and  
      5.  Loans and scholarships.  

                                                                                                                                             55  

----------------------- Page 64-----------------------

                                          Analyzing Gifts  

    Three steps to analyze if a gift is allowable or prohibited:   

    1. § 12A-12 general rule.  
    2. § 12A-12 listed exceptions and special rules.   
    3. Department rules that are stricter.   

                                                                                                                                        56  

Example of step three: some departments have a no gift policy.

   Reporting of Gifts - §12A-42  

   1. Find the form on the  city secretary’s web  page or  
          build your own.  
   2. Submit the report in an electronic format.  
   3. Certain  city officials  are required to file  a  “no  gift”  
          report  if  no  gift  was  accepted  in the  quarter. See  
         §12A-42(c)  for  the  complete  list of those required  
         to file a “no gift” report.  

                                                                                                                                       59  

Forms do not need to be sworn (no affidavit required).

What’s It Worth?   

1.   Face value  –  the price to  buy the  
     ticket  from  the  vendor  even  if the  
     ticket    has     no    price    or    says  
     “complimentary”.  
2.   Fair   market  value   –   what   the  
     public will pay for the ticket.  
3.   Estimate – educated guess.  

Pro-tip:  ask  the  donor  for  the  value  
and  get  something  in  writing  for  your  
records.  

                                                                                                     60

What counts as a year?  

•  Gift reporting is based on the calendar year.                                         

•  Gift totaling for calculating cumulative totals of small gifts  
    is   based   on   the   calendar   year   (The   Code   requires  
    cumulative gifts of $300 or more from a single source in a  
    single  year  to  be  reported  (§12A-42(a)(3).  So,  to  figure  
    out  the  cumulative  value  of  multiple  gifts,                                                   go  back  to  
    January  1st and count  all  gifts  since that date, but none  
    before that date).
