Background/History 

• The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) set  
  Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) regulations in 2022,  
  requiring formal training for entry-level drivers.  

    • This applies to those seeking to: 

        •  Obtain a Class A or Class B CDL for the first time; 

        •  Upgrade an existing Class B CDL to a Class A CDL; or 

        •  Obtain a school bus (S), passenger (P), or hazardous materials  
          (H) endorsement for the first time. 

                                                                                            40 
                                                                                             4 

----------------------- Page 44-----------------------

Background/History 

• Before ELDT, employees were on their own. 

    •  No formal training program was required. 

    •  Employees could practice on the equipment, if there was time. 

    •  Employees scheduled with DMV when they were ready to test. 

    •  Failed probation if CDL was not obtained within six months. 

                                                                                           41 
                                                                                            5 

----------------------- Page 45-----------------------

Background/History 

• The Impact of ELDT Regulations 
    •  Options included (1) hiring only employees with a CDL, (2) hiring outside  
      vendors, or (3) creating our own ELDT program 
    •  Option one would provide us with little to no opportunity to compete in  
      the marketplace for drivers with CDL license 
    •  Option two provides significant logistical and funding challenges to  
      address the shortage/turnover of drivers with a CDL license 
    •  Option three is what was chosen, and we have an outstanding support  
      team in our Street Operations division that: 
        • Researched the requirements 
        •  Completed the application process 
        • Registered us as a private training provider for the City of Dallas 

                                                                                                 42

         SUMMARY  
           
         The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) provides grant funds  
         through the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (“HOPWA”) Program, to assist  
         grantees in meeting the housing needs of low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and HIV- 
         related illness and their families within the grantee’s Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area  
         (“EMSA”).  Grant funding under the HOPWA Program (“HOPWA Grant”) is part of the  
         City’s HUD Consolidated Plan Budget. The Dallas EMSA includes seven counties:  Collin,  
         Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, and Rockwall Counties.  
           
         As the local grantee of HOPWA funds, the City of Dallas delivers a comprehensive set of  
         housing support services to eligible residents through a combination of the Fresh Start  
         Housing   Program   and   its   Community   Centers,   as   well   as   through   subrecipient  
         agreements with nonprofit organizations selected through a competitive bidding process  
         and an Interlocal Agreement with Dallas County Health & Human Services .    Prior to  
         FY2022-23, HOPWA subrecipient agreements were administered through the Office of  

                                                                “Our Product is Service”

            Homeless        Solutions      (“OHS”).      Beginning       with    FY2022-23,        HOPWA          subrecipient  
            agreements  were  transitioned  to  the  Office  of  Community  Care  (“OCC”)  in  order  to  
            consolidate the HOPWA Program under one department.  
             
           This agenda item authorizes the second of two one-year renewal options funded  under  
           the  FY  2024-25  HOPWA  Grant.  This renewal  option  includes  a small  increase  in  the  
            amount of $413,825.00 to enable the agencies to provide additional assistance under the  
            HOPWA  Program,  consisting  of:  (1)  Emergency/Tenant  Based  Rental  Assistance;  (2)  
            Facility  Based  Housing,  Master  Leasing,  and  Emergency  Vouchers;  (3)  Housing  
            Placement and Other Support Services; (4) Housing Facilities Rehabilitation/Repair; and  
            (5)   Housing   Information   Services   for   persons   living   with   HIV/AIDS   (collectively,  
            “Programs”).  These Programs are funded under the HOPWA Grant from HUD.  
             
            BACKGROUND  
             
            In  order to  identify  subrecipients,  on  March  3,  2022,  the  City’s  Office  of  Procurement  
            Services   (”OPS”)   issued  a  Request  for  Competitive  Sealed  Proposals  (“RFCSP”)  
            (#BRZ22-00018719) for OHS for HOPWA programs, providing assistance for low-income  
            persons living with HIV/AIDS in the Dallas EMSA.  The solicitation closed on April 8, 2022.  

            In response to the RFCSP, all proposers were recommended for award, but funding was  
            not sufficient, in all cases, to cover the full amount requested by proposers.  
             
            On February 22, 2023, the City Council authorized one-year service contracts, with two  
            one-year  renewal  options  contingent  on  available  funding,  with  a  term  beginning  on  
            October 1, 2022, with multiple providers and OCC took over administration of the FY2022- 
           23 HOPWA contracts once they were executed.     
             
            Due  to  a  substantial  increase  in  the  national  HOPWA  Grant  appropriation,  the  City’s  
            HOPWA Grant increased by over $1 million, which provided additional capacity to fund  
            renewal  contracts  at  levels  not  available  under  the  initial  award.  The  renewal  option  
            includes an increase in the amount of $413,825.00 to enable the agencies to provide  
            additional assistance under the HOPWA Program as shown below.  
             
            Funding  increases  were  applied  across  all projects  to  cover  increased  costs  of doing  
            business,      including      staff    salary     and     benefits,      occupancy,        utilities,   insurance,  
            maintenance, and other costs.   Emergency/Tenant Based Rental Assistance, Housing  
            Placement,  and  Master  Leasing  activities    are  receiving  funding  increases  to  sustain  
            housing  rent  subsidies  in  the  face  of  higher  market  rental  rates  and  higher  utility  
            assistance needed by eligible residents.   For these projects, the funding increases will  
            help  expand the number of residents served (within current staffing capacities).   Other  
            projects, like Facility Based Housing, are physically not able to expand their number of  
            housing units or persons served, but they have experienced increased operating costs  
            and are therefore also receiving increased funds in the renewal.

             On February 5, 2024, HSNT notified our office that: (1) the agency’s Tenant Based Rental  
             Assistance  (TBRA) project is projected to be overbudget by $150,000 by the end of the  
             contract      term,      and     (2)     the    agency’s        Short-Term          Rent,      Mortgage,         and     Utility  
             (STRMU)Assistance project is currently out of funds and unable to assist new clients. For  
             FY2023-24 due to substantial need, the City’s HOPWA Grant for Health Services of North  
             Texas  increased by $150,000.00 which provided additional capacity to fund contract at  
             levels not available under the initial award. The renewal option includes an increase in  
             the amount of $ 150,000.00 to enable the agencies to provide additional assistance under  
             the HOPWA Program as shown below.

         funding. This item represents additional added funding for FY25 programming.   
           
         The Reentry Services Program was established by the Texas State Legislature to support  
         projects in Dallas and Houston that strive to support individuals being release from TDCJ  
         facilities and returning to the Dallas or Houston area. This project has been supported  
         through appropriations in the 84th, 86th, 87th, and now the 88th Texas State Legislative  
         Session in 2023. Funding was once again appropriated within the budget for the Texas  
         Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to enter into an agreement with the City of Dallas  
         to establish and operate a program for reentry services to individuals released from TDCJ  
         facilities  who  are  returning  to  the  Dallas  area.  The  City  of  Dallas  may  enter  into  
         agreements with non-profit entities, faith-based organizations, community groups and the  
         private sector for the provision of services.

         considered by City Council:  
           
         File ID: 24-2204: Authorize an eighteen-month service contract for the distribution of in- 
         home garden kits to provide residents with a recurring supply of fresh grown produce for  
         the Office of Community Care  -  Bellcam Group, most advantageous proposer of four -  
         Not to exceed $200,000.00 -  Financing: ARPA Redevelopment Fund (subject to annual  
         appropriations)  
           
         Background  
         This  item  authorizes  a  contract  for  the  purchase  of  garden  box  kits  for  distribution  to  
         residents  in  targeted  communities.  Residents  will  be  able  to  submit  an  application  to  
         receive a garden box kit delivered to their home with sufficient materials to grow produce  
         for  6  months.  This  project  is  supported  by  ARPA  Redevelopment  Fund,  previously  
         Coronavirus State and Federal Fiscal Recovery Funds. The Garden Box Kit project aims  
         to impact food insecurity and promote healthy food consumption by creating a consistent  
         source of supplemental produce in the home.   
           
         The Garden Box Kit project was piloted in 2021 as a part of the City’s initial pandemic  
         response  programs.  The  project  was  well-received  and  distributed  garden  box  kits  to  
         more than 200 households in communities determined at highest risk, including those  
         with higher caseloads, with higher concentrations of older adults and zip codes identified  
         by reviewing the Community Health Needs Assessment.  The cost per  Garden Box Kit,  
         ranges  between $106 and $181 depending on size, includes all fees, with the vendor  
         responsible for direct mailing or delivery to the client.  The program distributed in-home  
         garden kits to provide residents with a recurring supply of fresh grown produce, shipped  
         via contactless delivery. Our goal is to serve approximately 250 to 500 residents over 2  
         to 3 phases, depending on demand and the number of applications received, ultimately  
         reaching between 500 and 1,000 residents. According to the program evaluation, more  
         than 90% of recipients said the garden kit was easy or very easy to set up and more than  
         half  stated  having  no  experience  with  gardening.  The  top  benefits  of  the  program,  
         according  to  respondents,  were  direct  food  access  (88%),  nutritious  meals  (77%),  
         ongoing supply of produce (74%), learning a new skill (71%), helping with mental wellness  
         (63%), and spending less on expensive grocery items like produce (62%).

              For this project, we sought garden box kits that are easy to set up and require minimal  
              space  so  that  individuals  with  little  to  know  gardening  experience  would  be  able  to  
              participate. The vendor was identified via a formal procurement process managed by the  
              Office of Procurement Services using a Request for Bids model. A total of 4 responses  
              were received and the contract is being awarded to the lowest bidder.

SUBJECT  Agreement with Dallas County to Provide Housing Assistance for Persons with  
         HIV/AIDS   
           
         On August 28, 2024, the following Office of Community Care item will be considered by  
         City Council:  
           
         Item 24-2170: Authorize an Interlocal Agreement in the amount of $2,824,600.00 with  
         Dallas  County  on  behalf  of  Dallas  County  Health  and  Human  Services  to  provide  
         scattered site housing assistance for persons with HIV/AIDS for the period October 1,  
         2024  through  September  30,  2025  -  Not  to  exceed  $2,824,600.00  -  Financing:  U.S.  
         Department of Housing and Urban Development Housing Opportunities for Persons with  
         AIDS Grant Funds  
         ody  
         Background  
           
         This agenda item authorizes an ILA with Dallas County Health and Human Services to  
         continue providing a HOPWA short-term rent, mortgage, and utility program and long- 
         term tenant based rental assistance program, including associated administrative costs.  
         Because HOPWA Grant Funds may be expended for eligible purposes within three years  
         of  HUD’s  award,  remaining  FY  2022-23  funds  are  included  in  this  year’s  Interlocal  
         Agreement (“ILA”) with Dallas County Health and Human Services.    
           
         This ILA was funded by FY 2023-24 HOPWA Grant Funds which was available beginning  
         October  1,  2023  and was  contingent upon HU  D's  approval  of  the  City's  FY  2023-24  
         Action  Plan,  and  execution  of  grant  agreements  with  HUD,  and  unspent  FY  2022-23  
         HOPWA Grant Funds.  
           
         Dallas   County   Health   and   Human   Services   has   a   long-established   history   of  
         administering  HOPWA  program  funds,  with  the  organizational  capacity  to  continue  
         providing  scattered  site  housing  assistance  to  eligible  persons  without  disruption,  
         including a full-time HOPWA manager, three full-time HOPWA caseworkers, and a full- 
         time HOPWA clerk, all provided through HOPWA funding. In addition, the County is the  
         administrative  agency  for  other  local  area  organizations  eligible  for  HIV/AIDS  grant  
         funding and, as  such,  has  collaborative  relationships  with  HIV/AIDS  service  providers  
         across the Dallas Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area. For these reasons, Dallas County  
         Health and Human Services is recommended for funding to continue providing scattered  
         site housing assistance services to eligible persons residing primarily in Dallas County.  
         To ensure eligible persons across the Dallas  Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area have

              Upcoming Office of Community Care Agenda Item – Dallas County  
SUBJECT  

              Emergency/Tenant-Based Rental Assistance  
   PAGE       2 of 2  

               
             access to the full continuum of HOPWA eligible activities, the City intends to enter into  
             additional  project  sponsor  agreements  with  entities  that  provide  additional  eligible  
             activities (e.g., facility-based housing, housing information services, housing placement,  
             and  support  services)  or  that  provide  scattered  site  housing  assistance  to  eligible  
             individuals outside of Dallas County. Dallas County Health and Human Services expects  
             to serve 310 households annually through this agreement.  
               
               
             Since approximately 1993, through ILAs with the City of Dallas, Dallas County Health and  
             Human Services has provided HOPWA scattered site housing assistance, comprised of  
             Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (“TBRA”), Short-Term Rent/Mortgage/Utility (“STRMU”)  
             Emergency Assistance, supportive services, and administrative costs, to eligible persons  
             primarily residing in Dallas County.   
               
             The TBRA Program includes long-term rental assistance (with a utility allowance) that an  
             eligible person may use at a housing unit of his or her choice. This assistance is portable,  
             and moves with the client, similar to the Housing Choice Voucher program, within the  
             Dallas Eligible Metropolitan Statistical Area. STRMU Emergency Assistance is designed  
             to prevent homelessness, and includes short-term rent, mortgage, and utility payments  
             for up to 21 weeks in any 52-week period. HOPWA clients receiving scattered site housing  
             assistance also receive housing support services through case managers, who ensure  
             that clients have access to other services, such as medical care, transportation, legal  
             services, and food pantry.

         File ID: 24-2301: Authorize the (1) acceptance of a grant from Texas Department of State  
         Health Services for the Texas Lactation Support After-Hours Hotline Grant (Contract No.  
         HHS001465500001) in the amount of $400,000.00 to fund after-hours lactation support  
         services for the Women, Infants, and Children Program for the period September 1, 2024  
         to August 31, 2025; (2) receipt and deposit of grant funds in the Texas Lactation Support

         conditions, and documents required by the agreement, approved as to form by the City  
         Attorney –  Not to exceed $400,000.00 –  Financing FY25 Texas Lactation Support After- 
         Hours Hotline Fund  
           
         Background  
         This item authorizes the acceptance of $400,000.00  to manage and support the Texas  
         Lactation  Support  After-Hours  Hotline  (TLSAH).  The  TSLAH  is  a  no-fee  assistance  
         service for lactating mothers to receive assistance and support. TSLAH services include  
         after-hours  lactation  support,  triage,  referral,  resource  sharing  and  the  provision  of  
         general and clinical breastfeeding information through telephone counseling provided by  
         International Board-Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs). Services can be offered in  
         multiple languages.  
           
         This  type  of  lactation  support  is  widely  accepted  as  an  effective  strategy  to  promote  
         positive  health  outcomes  for  both  mothers  and  their  babies.  The  purpose  of  this  
         partnership is to provide high-quality access to after-  hour support services in order to  
         address common barriers to breastfeeding and to promote higher breastfeeding rates and  
         exclusivity, over longer periods of time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and  
         Prevention’s most recent Breastfeeding Report Card, 85.9% of Texas babies born in 2017  
         were ever breastfed. However, that rate significantly declines to 55.1% at 6 months and  
         31.3%  at  12  months.  Additionally,  the  number  of  Breastfed  infants  receiving  formula  
         before 2 days of age is 22.5%, almost a quarter of the population (CDC 2020). Data from

              Pacify,  an  established  provider  of  these  services,  shows  that  this  type  of  support  
              contributes to a 13% increase in prenatal visits and a 23% increase in postpartum care.   
                
              The funding awarded will enable the Dallas WIC program to enter an agreement with a  
              vendor  to  provide  these  services,  which  serve  as  a  compliment  to  lactation  and  
              breastfeeding  support  services  that  are  provided  in  WIC  clinics,  thus  making  this  
              important support available and accessible 24-hours per day, 7 days per week.
