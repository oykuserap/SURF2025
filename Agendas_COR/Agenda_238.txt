SUBJECT  

        25 Cultural Organizations Program Contracts  
  
        On  October  23,  2024,  City  Council  will  consider  the  Fiscal  Year  2024-25  Cultural  
        Organizations Program (COP) contracts with 56 Dallas-based non-profit arts and cultural  
        organizations. The Cultural Organizations Program contracts with cultural organizations

        programming for residents and visitors of Dallas. The following pages list organizations  
        with their recommended contract amounts totaling $6,415,236 for FY 2024-25.  
  
        The  COP  Guidelines,  eligibility,  scoring,  and  review  process  are  aligned  with  Dallas  
        Cultural  Plan  goals  and  are  approved  annually  by  City  Council.  Following  guideline

        ALAANA (African, Latinx, Asian, Arab, Native American) individuals.

        to the review panel. The remaining 30 points of total 100 points are allocated to OAC  
        Administrative Scoring. The following is a breakdown of the categories of scoring. Further  
        detailed scoring information can be found on pages 10 through 13 of the attached  FY

             Following rigorous review of scores and past funding amounts, the FY 2024-25 awards  
             were  unanimously  recommended  by  the  Arts  and  Culture  Advisory  Commission  on  
             September  19, 2024. For  FY 2024-25, 56 non-profit organizations are recommended for  
             over   $6.4M   funding.   This   funding   represents   an   increase   of   $159,958,   or   an  
             approximately 2.6% budget increase from FY 2023-24 due to higher use of the Hotel  
             Occupancy Tax percentage for the program. OAC continues to leverage the use of HOT  
             funds  in  COP  due  to  the  direct  impact  funded  organizations  have  on  the  Dallas  arts  
             ecosystem and its nexus to cultural tourism.  
  
             Five organizations are recommended for COP contracts that were not part of the 2023-  
             24  COP  program.  The  four  first-time  organizations  in  the  COP  are:  Pegasus  Media  
             Project, Art House Dallas, The Artist Outreach, and the Nasher Sculpture Center. Deep  
             Vellum Publishing, Inc., was part of the program in FY 2022-23, did not apply in FY 2023-  
             24, and has rejoined for the FY 2024-25 year. The attached table below includes each  
             recommended organization’s name, contract amount, contract amount as  percentage of  
             annual budget, organization tier based on operating revenue, and mission statement .  

             Organization tiers are defined as follows:  
                  •    Tier 1 - $100,000 - $249,999  
                  •    Tier 2 - $250,000 - $499,999  
                  •    Tier 3 - $500,000 - $999,999  
                  •    Tier 4 - $1,000,000 - $2,999,999  
                  •    Tier 5 - $3,000,000 - $10,000,000  
                  •    Tier 6 - $10,000,000 and over

    DATE  October  18, 2024                                                                                                  CITY OF DALLAS

SUBJECT   Keep Dallas Beautiful Application Suite  
  
          The  Office  of  Data  Analytics  and  Business  Intelligence  (DBI),  in  partnership  with  the  
          Department of Code Compliance (CCS), has created a suite of applications to support  
          Keep Dallas Beautiful.  The applications, once published, will provide residents with a  
          user-friendly way to register for clean-up sites, reserve any necessary equipment, and  
          provide an interactive dashboard with in-depth information on the impact of Keep Dallas  
          Beautiful events.  
  
          In  the  past,  residents  used  time-consuming  paper  forms  to  register  for  cleanup  sites,  
          reserve equipment, and track the impact of the cleanups.  This new suite of applications  
          will enhance the registration process, customer experience, and provide valuable insights  
          into the cleanup efforts.  The Adopt-A-Spot application will allow volunteers to identify and  
          register for available Keep Dallas Beautiful locations quickly. Residents will be able to use  
          the Community Hand Tool Survey application to reserve equipment for cleanup events.  
          The Keep Dallas Beautiful Events Dashboard will provide residents and city personnel  
          with  a  wide  range  of  metrics  updated  bi-weekly  measuring  the  effectiveness  of  this  
          program such as:  
  
                •     Number of events and volunteers  
                •     Distribution of clean-up events  
                •    Volunteer hours served  
                •    Amount and type of trash collected  
                •     Monetary value of the services provided by volunteers  

          Please contact Dr. Brita Andercheck, Chief Data Officer, or Christopher Christian, Director  
          of CCS if you have any questions.

SUBJECT       Dallas Animal Services: Performance Dashboard  
  
             The Office of Data Analytics and Business Intelligence (DBI), in partnership with the  
              Dallas Animal Services Department (DAS), has worked to develop a fully automated  
              performance and at-risk animal identification dashboard.  

  
              Historically, shelter partners and residents were required to comb through multiple reports  
             and the open data portal to understand DAS performance metrics and identify at-risk  
             animals, a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. The dashboard automates the  
              reporting and identification  process, making the data easily accessible with thrice daily  
             updates on critical metrics, which include:  

                     •       Intakes  
                     •      Adoptions  
                     •      Shelter Capacity  
                     •      Animals at risk of euthanasia  
                     •      And more  
                                    o      DAS Performance Dashboard link available here  

              Please contact Dr. Brita Andercheck, Chief Data Officer, or Paul Ramon, Director of DAS,  
              if you have any questions.

         BACKGROUND  
  
         The published scope of the project is to create highly visible, welcoming artwork for a  
         dog park. The scope of the project is a site-specific installation of an artist designed and  
        fabricated canine themed sculpture. The artwork seeks engagement and to elicit  
         curiosity from viewers of all ages through design and high visibility. The artwork must  
         require little or no maintenance and be safe and appropriate for public outdoor work. It  
        will enhance the City of Dallas Public Art Collection with diversity of style, scale, media,  
         and artists, including ethnicity and gender.  
  
        ARTIST BACKGROUND  
        Artist Sujin Lim is an internationally acclaimed artist. Sujin Lim earned a BFA and MFA  
         in Sculpture from Seoul National University and an MFA in Public Art and New Artistic  
         Strategy from the Bauhaus University in Weimar. She was awarded a scholarship at the  
         Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2015. She has worked internationally  
         on public art for 14 years and participated in residency programs across the globe. Lim  
         has successfully collaborated with architects, engineers, and fabrication teams on over  
         25 public art commissions.  
         Her practice focuses on finding new ways of seeing the world within one’s surroundings.  
         She creates site-specific sculpture and installation projects which serve as points of  
         attraction for diverse groups of people to come together.  
  
         Her art practice involves research, the use of metaphor, and building physical, site-  
         specific sculptures and installations to transform actual sites into aspirational images  
        with the following question: “What might this space have become if the people using it

            had their desires met?”. Sujin Lim creates empowering and uplifting art to integrate  
            sensations and emotions into the built environment. She reveals the potential of a space  
            in continuous transition such as the dog park to become a distinct site of inspiration.  
  
            PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
  
            Sujin Lim performed a thorough site analysis during an initial site visit with distinct  
            community engagement elements. Her artwork Natural Encounter fuses an organic,  
            whimsical artwork with the geometrical Crockett Dog Park to create a welcoming, iconic  
            identity for the park and a community friendly sculpture.  
  
            The sculpture is 17’ long, 5’ wide and 21’ tall on a 12’ diameter and 18” high  
            underground concrete foundation. It will be surrounded by rubber mulch. The polyester  
            resin and fiberglass sculpture is supported by a rust proof metal armature and sealed  
            with UV and graffiti protective coating.  

            This project should serve as a wayfinding object, an interactive public art piece, and  
            unique Instagram background for the community. Visitors will be able to walk  
            underneath the sculpture and experience the installation intimately.  
  
            Natural Encounter will represent the relationship between living beings and nature by  
            bringing the image of a cloud softly sitting on the nose of a dog into the middle of the  
            park. Nature permits us to experience its wonders; it can also calm our minds and souls.  
            The sculpture will attempt to bring a dreamlike moment to our busy everyday lives.

SUBJECT  City Facilities Partners Update – AT&T Performing Arts Center  
  
         The City of Dallas Office of Arts and Culture typically contracts with various Dallas-based  
         arts  and  culture  non-profit  organizations  for  two  purposes.  The  most  common  is  
         contracting  for  artistic  and  cultural  services  for  Dallas  residents  and  visitors.  More  
         uniquely, Dallas contracts with select organizations to provide long-term management of  
         City-owned cultural venues. The Office of Arts and Culture (OAC) will provide a series of  
         monthly  memoranda  as  an  update  on  each  of  our  facility  management  partners  in  
         alignment with the Dallas Cultural Plan 2018 initiative to, “increase transparency in facility  
         policies and structures.”

           current  annual  City  funding  allocation  to  the  Center  is  $2,500,000  for  annual  City  
           operating  expenses  and  $1,500,000  for  additional  annual  operating  City  expenses,  
           totaling  $4,000,000.  Below  is  a  detailed  summary  of  the  original  agreement  and  its  
           amendments:  
  
           Original  Use  Agreement  (2005)  –  The  original  Use  Agreement  was  executed  on  
           December 15, 2005. The agreement was part of the larger public-private partnership that  
           allowed  for  the  creation  of  the  AT&T  Performing  Arts  Center.  Key  elements  of  the  
           agreement include:  
                •   Land Contribution: The City of Dallas provided prime land in the Dallas Arts District  
                    for the construction of the performing arts center.  
                •   Construction and Funding: The Dallas Center for the Performing Arts Foundation  
                    (DCPAF) was responsible for raising the funds needed to design, build, and equip  
                    the facilities. The center was constructed using a combination of private donations  
                    and public funds.  
                •   Operations and Maintenance: The DCPAF (later AT&T PAC) is responsible for the  
                    ongoing operation and maintenance of the facilities. The foundation is required to  
                    ensure   that   the   facilities   are   properly   maintained   to   high   standards,   both  
                    aesthetically  and  functionally,  to  preserve  their  value  and  attractiveness  to  the  
                    public and to performance groups.  
                •   City Funding Obligation: Annually, the City shall pay a portion of the operation and  
                    utilities cost in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000.  
                •   Public Use: The foundation agreed to make the facilities available for public use,  
                    including  hosting  city-sponsored  events,  community  performances,  and  other  
                    activities that would benefit Dallas residents. This public access is seen as a key  
                    aspect of the City's contribution, ensuring that the arts center will serve the broader  
                    community, not just the foundation's resident organizations.  
                •   Term of Agreement: The original agreement set a 40-year lease term with five (5)  
                    consecutive renewal terms of ten (10) years each.  

           Since the original 2005 agreement, there have been four (4) amendments made to the  
           agreement to reflect changes in the center’s operations, financial health, and community  
           needs.  

                •   First  Amendment  (2008)  –  The  first  amendment,  addressed  financial  and  
                    operational details related to construction of an additional parking garage (located  
                    under the Moody Performance Hall) and clarified certain aspects of the operational  
                    and maintenance responsibilities of the foundation regarding the additional garage,  
                    including allowing for use by DISD.  

                •   Second  Amendment  (2008)  –   The  Second  amendment  was  executed  in  
                    December 2008 to manage and minimize the sound impact of the Annette Strauss  
                    Square  on  the  Morton  H.  Meyerson  Symphony  Center.  This  amendment  

                                                               “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                       Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                52

                     introduced  a  joint  plan  for  annual  scheduling  of  events  including  day  and  time  
                     restrictions on activities and events performed at the Strauss.  
  
                 •   Third Amendment (2016) – The third amendment in 2016 dealt primarily with  the  
                     financial sustainability of the AT&T PAC. This amendment came after a thorough  
                     review  of  the  center's  operational  model  and  its  ability  to  meet  its  financial  
                     obligations  while  continuing  to  provide  high-quality  cultural  experiences  for  the  
                     public. Key aspects of this amendment included a debt restructuring agreement  
                     with the City of Dallas as well as additional funding in collaboration with OAC to  
                     provide an annual amount equal to $1,500,000 for operating expenses related to  
                     the Center in consideration of the Center’s ongoing work to benefit the performing  
                     arts  in  Dallas.  The  additional  funding  began  on  November  1,  2016,  and  will  
                     continue through and conclude on November 1, 2025.  

                 •   Fourth  Amendment  (2021) –  The  Fourth  amendment  was  executed  in  March  
                     2021 to amend the booking agreement and restrictions established in the second  
                     amendment to allow for further collaboration and coordination of booking activities  
                     to  maximize  the  use  of  Annette  Strauss  Square  and  the  Morton  H.  Meyerson  
                     Symphony Center.  

            2024 Bond
