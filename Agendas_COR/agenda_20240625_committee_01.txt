            persons  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  agricultural  operation  from  imminent  
            danger. 
          ▪ City council  makes a finding  by  resolution,  based on a  report  prepared  by the city

            health.

        Memorandum 

   DATE  June 20, 2024                                                                      CITY OF DALLAS  

    TO  Honorable Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, & Culture Committee  

SUBJECT  311 Department Budget Presentation  

       The purpose of this memorandum  is to provide an overview of the Department of 311  
        Customer Service’s (311)  current and planned budget, provide details on departmental  
        activities, and highlight current initiatives.  

        Budget Overview:  
        311 serves as a vital resource for residents to connect with their city for non-emergency  
       services.  The  current  FY2023-24  adopted  budget  is  $6,331,204  and  the  FY2024-25  
        planned budget is $6,673,249. The incremental increase in the planned budget is due to  
        merits, pension, health insurance and employer Medicare cost increases.   

         *January 2024 Forecast 

        311’s authorized positions for the current adopted budget are 135 positions with 109 of  
       those positions pertaining to contact center operations.  The planned budget assumes no  
        change in the number of authorized positions.   

                                                        “Service First, Now!”

           The following performance measures are monitored to track 311’s service delivery.  

            *FY 2023-24 –  1Qtr Report 

           Departmental Activities:  
           The following activities are integral to 311 and play a critical role in our overall services.  
               •   Contact Center Operations:  Provides 24/7/365 multi-lingual call center services 
                   and radio dispatch services for certain call types. 
               •   Workforce Management: Oversees end-to-end recruitment process and ensures 
                   adequate staffing by creating and managing work schedules. 
               •   Training: Provides comprehensive training skills in customer service excellence 
                   and effective communication to enhance customer experience. 
               •   Quality Assurance : Establishes and monitors quality standards for the call center 
                   by analyzing data and call recordings. 
               •   Outreach (City Hall on the Go): Engages the community by providing in-person 
                   resources at events and functions. 
               •   System       Configuration:        Responsible       for   service     request     metadata      and 
                   configuration.  Acts as the first point of contact for technical issues with the Dallas 
                   311 mobile application and the online portal. 

           Current Initiatives:  
           311’s initiatives for FY2023-24 are focused on reducing turnover, enhancing  customer  
           experience, and community engagement initiatives.   
               •   Reducing Turnover: 311 is diligently working on decreasing turnover. In FY2022, 
                   311  was  experiencing  57%  turnover  in  call  agent  positions  compared  to  28% 
                   today, which is closer to the call center industry standard of 25%. This reduction is 
                   attributed to better compensation, a renewed focus on employee morale activities, 
                   improved training, personnel development and a great management/Supervisory 
                   team.  In addition to reducing turnover,  311  continues to work on balancing  new 
                   agent  onboarding and  training processes  without reducing agent readiness and 
                   damaging  the  customer  experience  to  ensure  we  have  enough  call  agents  to 
                   reduce customer’s hold times.

                                                     Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                           48

                 •    Improving Customer Experience: Resident’s inability to see detailed contextual 
                      information regarding the status of their service request will be improved beginning 
                      July 2024. 311 has collaborated with vendor to expand text display capabilities on 
                      the online portal and Dallas 311 mobile app.  Furthermore, a project is underway

                      app campaign with a press conference.  This resulted in several news spots on 
                      CBS, WFAA, Univision and news articles.  The campaign included English and 
                      Spanish 30 second videos through APPs on Smart TVs and devices such as Roku, 
                      Apple TV, Firestick resulting in over 84K unique impressions. Furthermore, 311’s

SUBJECT  

          Property containing Michael M. Boone Elementary (HPISD) and Adjacent Church  

         Summary  
  
         The purpose of this memorandum is to brief the City Council Quality of Life, Arts & Culture  
         Committee on a request for a boundary adjustment to remove 12.3671 acres of land from  
         the Dallas city limits, plus adjacent rights-of-way. The Highland Park Independent School  
         District  submitted a  completed application  for a  boundary adjustment from  the  City  of  
         Dallas  to  join  the  City  of  University  Park  in  conjunction  with  the  adjacent  Northway  
         Christian  Church  in  June  2023.  City  staff  have  responded  with  supplemental  service  
         delivery information for consideration of the Committee in formulating a recommendation  
         on whether to proceed to City Council to permit negotiations to occur.  
  
         Background  

         On July 1, 2022, the City of University Park submitted an application and payment for a  
         boundary  adjustment  to  remove  the  Michael  M.  Boone  Elementary  School  property  
         (4.6308 acres) from City of Dallas jurisdiction. Once staff reviewed the request, it was  
         noted that state law requires the boundary adjustment to be contiguous to the existing  
         city. The applicant was informed of the requirement and the decision was made to expand  
         the area of request to include the intermediary property containing Northway Christian  
         Church (7.7363 acres), west of the school. On June 12, 2023, the completed application  
         was submitted with all required information and authorizations from the church and school  
         district.  The  application  notes  the  purpose  of  the  request  is  to  provide  continuity  of  
         services between the City of University Park and HPISD schools, noting that 80 percent  
         of  students  are  UP  residents.  In  all,  the  two  properties  and  surrounding  rights-of-way  
         contain a total of over 18 acres of land.  

         Staff does not make a recommendation on boundary adjustments. However, service delivery  
         within the past five years and a foregone analysis of potential tax base loss is provided for  
         consideration of the Committee in deciding a recommendation for the request.  

         The area is serviced by Dallas Water Utilities for water and wastewater running along the  
         adjacent streets surrounding the property. Dallas Police reported 23 calls including four

            Consideration of a Boundary Adjustment for the City of University  
SUBJECT     Park; Property containing Michael M. Boone Elementary (HPISD) and  
            Adjacent Church  
   Page     2 of 3  

           blockage, CIT right care, and random gun fire.  Dallas Fire  Department reported 10 runs  
           in five years with an average response time of 05:53. Calls for assistance included a  
           person locked in a vehicle, automatic fire alarm, allergic reaction, welfare check, syncope,  
           breathing  difficulty,  medical  emergency,  and  injured  person.  DFD  also  provided  the  
           Automatic Assistance Agreement which authorizes the two cities to service the area and  
           share resources at no cost. Code Compliance noted three calls were made for prohibited  
           watering (two) and a banner sign violation (one).  

           The current land uses of a public school and church do not produce a tax base. The  
           foregone analysis completed by the Budget Management Services Department identified  
           the development area (not streets/alleys), with existing zoning for single-family residential  
           uses, with the potential for future redevelopment at the current tax base compared to over  
           300 adjacent single-family lots tax value. The total revenue foregone if the land area is  
           redeveloped with taxable single-family uses is an average of $2,939,402.28 and a median  
           of $2,711,449.77 annually.  

           Next Steps  

            If the Committee recommends approval of the boundary adjustment, the request will be  
           forwarded to City Council to authorize the City Manager to negotiate with the applicant on  
           terms of the boundary adjustment, including potential lost revenue. Once a resolution  
           authorizes the negotiation and terms are met between the two parties, an ordinance with  
           negotiated terms will return to City Council, including a service plan from the City of University  
           Park, and the approved legal descriptions identifying the property and surrounding rights-of-  
           way. Finally, the City of University Park will be required to adopt the area and perform the  
           public safety and works services necessary for the adjusted area. The case is completed  
           when staff sends a letter to the state notating the amended municipal boundaries.

Boundary Adjustment Process 

•  Texas Local Government Code Sec. 43.015 Authority of Adjacent  
   Municipalities to Change Boundaries by Agreement: 

    •  Adjacent municipalities may make mutually agreeable changes in  
      their boundaries of areas that are less than 1,000 feet in width. 

    •  The boundary adjustment process usually includes two steps.  
      Council authorizes the City Manager to enter discussions regarding  
      a potential boundary adjustment. 

        1.  Council authorizes the City Manager to execute a boundary  
            adjustment agreement. 

        2.  Council and University Park adopt ordinances agreeing to the  
            boundary adjustment after successful negotiations.  

                                                                                                78

----------------------- Page 82-----------------------

Next Steps 

•  If QOLAC recommends to send the request to City Council: 

     1.  City Council will consider a resolution allowing the city manager  
         to start negotiating potential terms of the boundary adjustment.  

     2.  Once terms are agreed upon, the ordinance is presented to City  
         Council for approval or denial.  

     3.  University Park passes an ordinance accepting the land and  
         service agreement.  

•  If QOLAC does NOT send the request to City Council: 

    •  The paid application is closed/denied.

         On November 9, 2022, the Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI), Office of Community Care  
         (OCC) and Dallas Animal Services (DAS)  submitted  an  application for the  NLC  Cities  
         Addressing Fines and Fees (CAFFE) cohort in alignment with Dallas’ Racial Equity Plan  
         (REP). The application amplified the City’s commitment to addressing inequities through  
         the REP, and specifically identified an opportunity to address disparities in DAS’ pet fines  
         and fees. The City of Dallas was selected to be one of eight cities (Birmingham, AL; Las  
         Vegas, NV; Maywood, IL; Montgomery, AL; Pueblo, CO; St. Louis, MO; and Washington,  
         DC)  to  partake  in  a  two  phase  cohort  inclusive  of  a  $40,000  grant  and  Technical  
         Assistance and Support to address the impacts of municipal fines and fees on residents.  
            
         On October 25, 2023, NLC provided a MOU to the City of Dallas confirming the awarded  
         $30,000 implementation grant funds to the City in addition to the $10,000.00 planning (not  
         to  exceed  $40,000.00)  to  support  the  CAFFE  project.  The  CAFFE  initiative  aims  to  
         strengthen the financial security of families who are at risk of losing income and assets.  
         This is in alignment with Dallas’ REP and Equity Indicators Report, which notes disparities  
         in Fines and Fees—  specifically,  Equity Indicator 40: Fines and Fees (60) that outlines  
         disparities surrounding communities that are fined.  According to the  2019  report  “High  
         fines and fees may reduce lower-income defendants’ ability to pay for other essential  
         needs, such as housing, transportation, or food...”  
           
         Communities below I-30 have higher instances of receiving civil citations. 42% of non- 
         payment citations are from five zip codes: 75216, 75217, 75241, 75212, and 75211.    
         Through the cross-collaborative partnership between OEI, DAS, OCC and  NLC CAFFE  
         we are working to address disparities in fines and fees without compromising public safety  
         in the following ways:  
              1.   Incentivizing  residents impacted by Dallas Animal Services fines and fees, with a  
                   focus on  animal at  large, no proof  of  vaccination or tags, not microchipped,  or  
                   spayed or neutered.   
              2.   Connecting  impacted  residents  to  other  city  services  that  can  support  debt  
                   reduction such as the Financial Empowerment Center.   
              3.  Acquiring consulting services  to  support alternatives to ability to pay policy-level  
                   recommendations and key practices to address inequitable fines and fees.   

                                                                  “Service First, Now!”  
                                                          Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                       82

SUBJECT  Quality of Life, Arts and Culture Committee Proposed 2025 Legislative Priorities  
           
         As the City of Dallas prepares for the 89th Texas Legislature and 119th Congress, both  
         set to convene in 2025, the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee worked with the  
         Office of Government Affairs and stakeholders to develop the City’s legislative programs  
         for consideration.  
           
         Preliminary legislative priorities pertaining to quality of life, arts, and culture include:  
           
              •     Increase  funding  for  the  Texas  State  Library  Archives  Commission  relating  to  
                   technology and digital inclusion. (State)  
              •    Clarify the regulation of public libraries. (State)  
              •    Support  the  legalization  of  gambling  as  a  revenue  generator  to  fund  pension  
                    liabilities. (State)  
              •    Seek proper funding and resources for the physical and mental healthcare for all  
                    residents of Dallas. (Both)  
              •     Reduce  barriers  to  sober   and  supportive  housing  and  medication-assisted  
                   treatment. (Both)   
              •     Decriminalize the use of fentanyl testing strips. (Both)  
              •     Increase  funding  for  the  Texas  Cultural  Association’s  Culture  District  Program.  
                   (Both)  
              •    Support legislation that promotes proper mental and physical healthcare for all.  
                   (Both)  
              •    Support the legalization of marijuana. (Both)  
           
         In addition to the items above, we  urge  legislative efforts include maintaining existing  
         funding streams at both the state and federal levels. We know additional items may arise  
         between  now  and  the  start  of  the  next  legislative  session,  and  we  understand  City  
         Councilmembers can bring forward items as desired through the Ad Hoc Committee on  
         Legislative Affairs at any time.
