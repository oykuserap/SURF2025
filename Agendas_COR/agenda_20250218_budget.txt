  2024 Accomplishments  

1. Expanding Library Access : The Library implemented six-day service at 14 additional locations, providing  
  increased access to educational and cultural resources for over 1.5 million residents. This initiative  
  bridged literacy gaps and reinforced the Library's commitment to underserved communities.  

2. Equitable Senior Services: The Office of Community Care and Empowerment finalized a contract to  
  develop a Senior Services Strategic Plan, delivering expanded programs to meet the needs of 37% more  
  seniors citywide, enhancing their access to nutrition, wellness, and transportation support.  

3. Transforming Urban Blight : The Code Compliance Department demolished 44 major nuisance  
  properties and launched the Bloomberg Love Your Block initiative, engaging over 200 community  
  volunteers to rejuvenate neighborhoods in equity-priority areas.  

4. Cultural Inclusivity Milestone: The Office of Arts and Culture dedicated the “Shadowlines” public art  
  installation, honoring victims of racial violence and increasing public access to culturally significant art in  
  historically underserved communities.  

5. Historic Preservation Impact: Advanced  historic designations for Wheatley Place and Colonial Hills,  
  supported by grants and an economic impact study that projected a $5 million increase in property  
  values through preservation-driven development.  

6. Sustainability in Action: Environmental Quality facilitated community tours in South Dallas, aligning  
  stakeholders on infrastructure needs that unlocked $2.3 million in funding opportunities, reinforcing  
  environmental justice goals.  

7. Justice Reimagined: Community Courts expanded  restorative justice programs, connecting 1,250  
  offenders with wrap-around services like  housing and employment assistance,  resulting in a 30%

  Funding - City of Dallas Public Art Ordinance  
  established January 1, 1989  
  
                                   1989 City Public Ordinance applies a "percent for the arts" to all capital improvement  
 Where do Public Art               projects  
 dollars come from?                  •   0.75 percent if project is exclusively street, storm drainage, utility or sidewalk improvements  
                                     •   1.5 percent of the total project appropriation for all other capital improvement projects  
                                     •   .75 percent for trails  

  

 How can the money                  Funding can be used for design services of artists; selection, acquisition,  
         be used?                   documentation, commissioning and display of artworks; and administrative costs.

                                         bond funding has been issued – this creates a Public Art "bank account" for  
How are budgets and                      each of these department  
   locations set for a  
         project?  
                                   2.   Public Art works with Bond Office and funding department to identify project

   DATE  January 17, 2025                                                                            CITY OF DALLAS  

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee  

        Office of Arts and Culture – FY 2025-26 Cultural Organizations Program  
SUBJECT  

         Guidelines  
         
        On February 26, 2025, City Council will consider a resolution authorizing and establishing  
        the Cultural Organizations Program (COP) and approve the COP guidelines for fiscal year  
        2025-26.       The     Cultural     Organizations         Program       contracts      with    arts and   cultural  
        organizations  with   budgets   ranging   from   $100,000   to   over   $10 million  to  provide  
        an  annual  season  of  programming  for  residents  and  visitors  of Dallas.  In  FY  2024- 
        25,  City  Council  authorized  contract  amounts  totaling  $6,166,801 to 55 organizations  
        under this program.  
         
        The FY 2025-26 COP guidelines align with Dallas Cultural Plan 2018 priorities,  including  
        alignment  to  staff  and  board  diversity  goals,  and  resident  panel  evaluation of  cultural  
        programming in neighborhoods around Dallas.  
         
        In  an  effort  to  respond  to  the  ever-growing  administrative  demands  of  Dallas  arts and  
        culture organizations, volunteer review panelists, and City staff, the FY 2025-26 COP  
        guidelines propose an administrative change to the execution of the program moving from  
        a one-year cycle to a three-year cycle. The FY 2025-26 COP application will be open to  
        all eligible new and returning applicants and will serve as year one of the three-year cycle  
        with all application, review, and scoring requirements remaining consistent with prior COP  
        guidelines. FY 2026-27 and FY 2027-28 will serve as years two and three respectively.  
         
        During  these  interim  years,  returning  applicants  will  complete  a  significantly shortened  
        application process that will not require panel review. All returning applicants will instead  
        submit an updated scope of services for the upcoming year, as well as a shortened written  
        application for which applicants will receive updated and more  detailed administrative  
        scoring for funding recommendations. Administrative scoring   and  compliance  will  hold  
        more  significance  in  the  review  and  funding  allocation process for returning applicants  
        to   emphasize   the   importance   of   contract   compliance,   financial   compliance,   and  
        adherence to Cultural Policy diversity criteria.  
         
        New  organizations  wishing  to  apply  for  COP  may  be  eligible  to  apply  during  the  
        second and/or third years of the three-year cycle (FY 2026-27 / FY2027-28). During these  
        interim  years,  new  applicants  will  complete  a  similar  application  process  as the full  
        first-year application of a cycle to include a video submission, panel review process,  and  
        panel  question  and  answer  session  to  determine  eligibility  and   acceptance   into   the  
        program.  Additionally,  even  if  funded,  applicants  must  repeat  a full application when  
        the following year one of the three-year program cycle occurs,  likely FY 2028-29.  

                                                              “Service First, Now!”  
                                                       Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                 60 50

  SUBJECT     Program Guidelines  
   PAGE       Page 2 of 2  

             
             Each year of the three-year cycle, City Council will review and approve updated Cultural  
             Organizations   Program   guidelines   and   subsequent   funding   allocations   to   eligible  
             organizations. This practice is aligned with Cultural Policy and maintains the same level  
             of review and approval from City Council as prior years’ COP processes.  

             Other updates made in the proposed FY 2025-26 COP guidelines are:  
                  •    Application and program timeline  
                  •     Program   eligibility   language  to   emphasize   the   required   compliance   to  the  
                        provisions of the National Labor Relations Act  
                  •    Clarification  that  all  core  annual  programming  must  be  open  to  the  public  for  
                        residents and visitors of Dallas and be listed on GoSeeDFW  
                  •     Minor  wording  and  document  flow  updates  to  improve  readability  for  new  and  
                        returning applicants, clarify requirements, and update submission deadlines and  
                       dates  
                  •     Proposed  administrative  scoring  for  FY  2026-27  and  FY  2027-28,  which  are  
                       subject  to  change  as  updated  guidelines  are  brought  back  to  City  Council  for  
                       approval  

             After the FY 2025-26 COP application and review process, cultural service contracts and  
             related funding allocations are awarded in accordance with Cultural Policy. All funding  
             recommendations will first be considered by the Allocations Committee of the Arts and  
             Culture Advisory Commission followed by the full Arts and Culture Advisory Commission.  
             The Commission’s funding recommendations will then be brought to City Council in the  
             Fall of 2025 for final review and authorization to execute the associated cultural service  
             contracts.  
             
             Please  contact  me  or  the  Director  of  Arts  and  Culture,  Martine  Philippe,  with  any

Office of Arts and Culture  

Vision  

The  Office of  Arts  and  Culture  aims  to create  an  equitable,  diverse,  and  connected  community, whose residents  and  
visitors thrive through meaningful arts and cultural experiences in every neighborhood across Dallas.  
  
Mission  

The Office of Arts and Culture  works to enhance the vitality of the city and the quality of life for all Dallas residents by  
creating an equitable environment wherein artists as well as arts and cultural organizations thrive; people of all ages enjoy  
opportunities for creative expression; and all celebrate our multicultural heritage.  

  
Our  mission  is  to  support  and  grow  a  sustainable  cultural  ecosystem  that  ensures  all  residents  and  visitors  have  
opportunities to experience arts and culture throughout the city.  
  
Statement  on  Cultural  Equity  

In  Dallas, we envision a city of  people whose success and well-being are  not  pre-determined  by their  race, age, disability,  
sexual orientation, gender, social status, zip code, or citizenship status.  We recognize that artistic and cultural expression  
are fundamental to the development of our identity, as individuals and as a community at large.  We assert the right for  
all people to have access to arts and cultural experiences throughout Dallas.  
  
We recognize the historic legacies of  racism, overt bias and injustice that shape our present reality.   In fact, the City of  
Dallas’ arts funding originated to support organizations of the Western European canon, collectively referred to as “The  
Big Six.” Going forward, we will strive to support the broadest range of art forms and creative producers, considering  
inclusivity, diversity, and  neighborhood impact to direct  resources equitably to artists and organizations. We will work to  
build a robust arts ecosystem that continually evolves to better reflect the diverse composition of Dallas.  Towards this  
end, we recognize and affirm the potential of new and emerging artists and organizations.  

The Office of Arts and Culture will serve as convener and connector to catalyze equity in the policies and  practices of its  
partners across the Dallas arts ecosystem.  Core to this is leading other organizations and private resource providers to  
advance  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  in  concrete,  measurable  ways.  Annually,  the  Office  of  Arts  and  Culture  will  
summarize its own support for artists and arts organizations, highlighting measures of equity and diversity.  
  
As we work together to create a more vibrant Dallas, the Office of Arts and Culture is committed to nurturing the wide  
diversity of creative culture and experiences that make up this great city.

About the Cultural Organizations Program  

The Cultural Organizations Program (COP) is the program through which the City of Dallas Office of Arts and Culture (OAC)  
provides operational support as described by the Dallas Cultural Policy, approved by City Council on November 28, 2018  
[Section  5(D)(i)].  Per  the  Dallas  Cultural  Policy,  the  Office  of  Arts  and  Culture  contracts  for  cultural  services  with  
established,  Dallas-based  non-profit  organizations  for  a  variety  of  cultural  programs  that  include  concerts,  plays,  
exhibitions, performances, workshops, and other cultural programming for the benefit  of Dallas residents and visitors.  
These cultural service contracts are awarded annually using a review panel approach to evaluate applications. Program  
eligibility and review criteria are published annually.  
  
This document contains guidelines, deadlines and application instructions for the COP managed by the OAC for fiscal year  
(FY) 2025-26. Please refer to the appropriate sections of this guide for more detailed information about the different parts  
of this program. The FY 2025-26 City of Dallas fiscal year begins October 1, 2025, and ends September 30, 2026.  

All  applicants  are  required  to  read  the  guidelines  and  application  instructions  for  details  of  program  eligibility  and  
requirements prior to beginning the application process. Guidelines are updated every funding cycle.  
  
The Director may approve variances from these guidelines; however, material variances shall require City Council approval.  
  
Material variances include:  
•    Changes in tier structure  
•    Changes in scoring criteria  
•     Non-profit status  requirements  
•    Status as a Dallas-based organization or artist  
•    Changes to ineligible activities  
  
COP  Eligibility  Requirements  

Organizations must meet the following criteria to qualify for COP funding:  
  
•     Must be a 501(c)(3) Public Charity as provided by the U.S.  Internal  Revenue Code, as amended, in good standing for  
     at least three years.  
•     Must be authorized to transact business in the State of Texas.  
•     Must be an established City of Dallas arts or cultural organization with an operation history of at least three years.  
•    Organizations must have administrative offices permanently located in the City of Dallas. This does not include P.O.  
     Boxes – the organization must have a physical Dallas administrative office address.  
•     Must have an annual operating budget of at least $100,000.00, based on the organization’s prior year’s unrestricted  
     operating revenue, excluding in-kind revenues. An applying organization must be able to verify the most recently  
     completed fiscal year’s unrestricted revenue through a Form 990, Form 990-EZ, or third-party financial audit.  
           o  An organization that is a returning applicant (funded in the Cultural Organizations Program for FY 2024-25 at  
                the time of application) may, at the OAC Director’s discretion, be granted one probationary year in which it is  
                allowed to have a  reported  revenue  below $100,000.00 for the  prior year’s  revenue.  If the probationary year  
                is granted, the organization will be considered a Tier 1 organization for the probationary year. The organization  
                will be required to have at least one paid full- or part-time employee as described below throughout the 12- 
                month contract period of the probationary year. The organization may only be granted a single  probationary  
                year.  After  the  probationary  year,  the  organization  must  achieve  revenues  of  at  least  
                $100,000.00, as demonstrated by a Form 990, Form 990-EZ, or third-party financial audit, to be eligible for the

COP  Diversity  Requirements  

Per the Cultural  Policy of the City of  Dallas, organizations funded through COP should aim to meet the following goals, as  
set forth in the Cultural Policy. Organizations’ progress will be monitored by the OAC on an ongoing basis and OAC staff  
are available to answer any questions or provide guidance on achieving these goals:  

      (1)  Have  board-approved  safe  workplace  policies  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  anti-discrimination  and  anti-  
           harassment policies).  
      (2)  Have a policy and measurable goals related to equity, diversity and inclusion that is board-approved and published  
           on their website.  
                              2 
      (3)  Board Diversity  goals (by organization  budget size):  
                a.   Annual operating budget of $5 million and above: at least 30% board diversity.  
                b.   Annual operating budget of $1 million - $5 million: at least 20% board diversity.  
                c.   Annual operating budget of $500,000.00 to $1 million: at least 10% board diversity.  
      (4)  For organizations with operating budgets over $1 million: offer paid internships with livable wages to increase the  
           diversity of the pipeline for future arts leaders.  

Funding  Level  Restrictions  

A.  The limit on support through COP is scaled to be proportional, based on the  higher  of (1) the unrestricted operating  
revenue  from  the  previous  year’s  official  audited  records,  Form  990,  or  Form  990  EZ  or  (2)  the  average  unrestricted  
operating revenue from the  previous three (3) years’ official audited  records,  Forms 990, or  Forms 990 EZ, and  in no case  
shall the amount of funding for an organization through COP be greater than:  

      (i)       30% of the applicant organization’s revenues up to $250,000.00;  
      (ii)      25% of the applicant organization’s revenues  between $250,000.00 to $1  million;  
      (iii)     15% of the applicant organization’s revenues between $1 million to $5 million;  
      (iv)      10% of the applicant organization’s revenues greater than $5 million  

NOTE: All funding level  restriction calculations shall  be made excluding  in-kind  revenues.  
B.  Total support by the City in a fiscal year, whether cash or in-kind, regardless of the department from which the funds  
and support originate, shall not exceed:  
  
      (i)       50% of an organization’s most recent year’s audited revenue for organizations with revenue less than $1  
                million.  
      (ii)      40% of an organization’s most recent year’s audited revenue for organizations with revenue of $1 million or  
                more.  
  
C.  In-kind support includes, but is not limited to, utility payments made directly by the City, payments made to a third  
party, including other City departments, in support of the organization, and facility use fee discounts at Cultural Centers.  

Source  of  Cultural  Support  Funds  

The City of Dallas invests in the arts by allocating a portion of the City’s general fund (primarily property and sales tax  
collections) and a portion of Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT) revenue to eligible applicants who meet the established  
program criteria and are recommended for funding after an application and review panel process. Per state law,  
  

  

2  Diversity (as relates to  board goals)  means the percentage of non-majority (based on race/ethnicity)  members of a board.  For example, if the goal  

is at least 30% diversity on a board, an organization meeting that goal must have no more than 70% of any one racial/ethnic group on their board.

revenue from the municipal Hotel Occupancy Tax collection may be used only to promote tourism and the convention  
and hotel industry (Texas Tax Code, Chapter 351.101. Use of Tax Revenue).  

New Applicants  

New applicants are applicants submitting proposals to the  program for the first time, as well as to applicants that  have  
applied in the past but are not currently funded through the program during the FY 2024-25 year.  
  
New applicants must contact OAC staff (OACFundingPrograms@dallas.gov) before the application deadline, by April 9,  
2025. This is to ensure that the applicant is aware of the COP requirements and additional i nformation that is needed.  

FY 2025-26 Cultural Organizations Program (COP)  

NEW for FY 2025-26: In the FY 2025-26 funding year, the Cultural Organizations Program will begin a three-year cycle.  
The FY 2025-26 application will look and feel similar to  previous years’ applications; however, the following two years  
(FY 2026-27 and FY 2027-28) will be significantly shortened and will consider administrative scores only. There will be  
no panel review requirements. Please see the “COP as a Multi-Year  Program: Planning for  FY 2026-27 and FY 2027-28”  
section for more information.  
  
The organization is responsible for the quality, completeness and timely submission of the proposal and supplemental  
materials. Application steps and deadlines are included in this document and online at dallasculture.org.  OAC staff are  
available to answer additional questions. (See Contact OAC.)  Post-application, OAC staff may  reach out to applicants with  
questions or clarifications; organizations are responsible for responding in a timely manner.  

All organizations, new and previously funded, must complete an application and review process  to be considered for  
funding through the FY 2025-26 Cultural Organizations Program (COP).  
  
The FY 2025-26 COP Application can be found on the COP page of the OAC website at: https://dallasculture.org/cultural-  
programs/cultural-organizations-program/. Applications must be submitted via the online application system by  Friday,  
April 18, 2025, at 11:59 PM.  Hard copies of applications will not be accepted.  
  
To assist with the application process, the OAC staff will host information sessions, both virtual and in person, in March  
and April. These dates will  be posted on the OAC website at the time of the online application opening. The week before  
the  deadline,  OAC  staff  will  also  host  online  “office  hours”  for  individual  questions  on  a  drop-in  basis.  Additionally,  
returning  applicant  organizations  may  request  feedback  on  prior  years’  applications  from  OAC  staff.  All  information  
sessions and office hours are optional and do not impact application scoring.  

NOTE:  An organization that submits a substantially  incomplete application at the time of the deadline, as deemed by the  
Office of Arts and Culture, will receive notification via e-mail as to the incomplete status of the application from OAC staff.  
This could result in the application being rejected. While staff will make significant effort to communicate deadlines to  
organizations  in  advance,  please  note  that  the  COP  application  deadline  is  non-negotiable,  and  it  is  the  sole  
responsibility of the applicant to ensure its timely submission.

review panels. In no instance shall a City employee, Arts and Culture Advisory Commissioner, or other City official be a

reviewed by the  review panel. Changing tiers  may also change specific OAC administrative scoring criteria.  Please refer  
to the “OAC Administrative Scoring,” section under "Scoring,” below.  
  
Panel  Review  

In lieu of in-person presentations, each applicant will be required to submit a 10-minute maximum presentational video  
and attend a  10-minute question and answer session via a web-meeting  platform (e.g. Zoom,  Microsoft Teams, etc.) with  
the applicant’s respective panel. Both are required; applying without a video or not attending an assigned question and  
answer session may lead to disqualification from the award or a maximum of 60% of the organization’s FY 2024-25 funding  
level. A new applicant who does not submit a video or does not attend the question-and-answer session will not be eligible  
for funding in FY 2025-26.  

Applicants may reference the FY 2025-26 COP Timeline above for a date during which the question-and-answer sessions  
for each tier will take place. A shorter 30-minute timeslot will be made available to applicants at least a week in advance  
of the question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, applying organizations must be represented  
by principal figures, e.g. the Executive Director, Artistic Director, Board  President and/or a Financial Officer or other staff

Selection & Funding Allocation Process  

FY 2025-26 COP funding allocations will  be initially reviewed and recommended by the Allocations Committee of the Arts  
and  Culture  Advisory  Commission.  The  Allocations  Committee  recommends  a  level  of  funding  for  each  organization  
considering  applicant  scoring,  funding  projections,  contract  compliance,  fiscal  standing  of  applying  organizations,  and  
standing compared to  peer organizations. These  recommendations are then  reviewed and recommended  by the full Arts  
and Culture Advisory Commission. The Commission’s recommendation is then forwarded to the City Council through the  
City Manager's Office. The recommended allocation and individual contracts will  receive approval or modification by the  
City Council in October of each year pending City of Dallas budget approval.  
  
Be advised that prior year funding allocations are not guaranteed in the FY 2025-26 funding allocation process and may  
change based on the aforementioned factors.  
  
NOTE: A new applicant whose normalized score is below 70% will not be eligible for  funding  in FY 2025-26.

Compliance  

COP contracts require compliance for the entirety of the contract period (October 1, 2025 –  September 30, 2026).  Any  
major contract compliance issues, such as current audits not being received, or other similar items will be presented to  
the Allocations Committee to recommend a course of action to be taken. This will then be presented to the full Arts and  
Culture Advisory Commission for recommendation of funding continuation.  
  
To signify a willingness to comply with COP Guidelines, awarded organizations will be required to attend a mandatory  
training in November 2025. Post-training, organizations must provide the following to maintain compliance throughout  
the year:  

Financial  Reports  
  
An  annual  financial  report  must  be  submitted  to  the  OAC  no  late r  than  six  months  after  the  completion  of  the  
organization’s fiscal year. Depending on an organization’s operational budget size, the organization will submit a third-  
party financial audit, a Form 990, or a Form 990-EZ (see table below). Failure to meet a financial report submission deadline  
may result in withholding contract payments.  
  
  Budget Size                                  Financial  Report Type  
  $100,000.00 - $199,999.99                    Form 990-EZ, Form 990, or Financial Audit

A monthly report listing Dallas activities and programs presented by the organization, the total attendance at each activity  
and supporting information must be submitted by the 15th day of each month (reporting the prior  month’s activities) to  
OAC.  Monthly  reports  consistently  completed  incorrectly  after  correction  from  OAC  staff  may  be  considered  “late”  
submissions.  
  
If organizations choose to share upcoming events and activities with their City Council representatives and/or the Arts and  
Culture Advisory Commission, there is an optional tab in the Monthly Report to do so.

Final Report  
  
A final evaluation report summarizing activities for the contract period must be submitted to OAC by October 31, 2026.

Business Inclusion and Development: Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises  
  
It is the policy of the City of Dallas to use qualified Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) to the  
greatest extent  feasible on  the  City’s  construction, procurement,  and  professional  services  contracts. The  City  and  its  
contractors shall  not discriminate  based on  race, color,  religion,  national origin, age or sex  in the award and  performance  
of contracts. In consideration of this policy, the City of Dallas has adopted the Business Inclusion and Development Plan  
(BID Plan)  for  all  City of Dallas  contracts. The  purpose  of  the  Business  Inclusion  and  Development Plan  is  to  increase  
participation  of  M/WBEs  in  City  procurement  and  contracting  opportunities,  and  to  develop  the  local  business  base  
through awarding contracts and purchases to  locally owned businesses. Under the  BID  Plan,  bidders/proposers  must sign  
an affidavit agreeing to comply with the City’s BID Plan.  

The BID Plan shall apply to all City contracts for the procurement of construction, architectural and engineering, goods,  
other services, and professional services, with emphasis on first tier subcontracts on City contracts over $50,000.00. As a  
prerequisite  for  City  Council  award,  the  prime contractor must make a  good  faith  effort  to meet established  M/WBE  
subcontracting  goals  and  if  goals  are  not  met,  must  demonstrate  and  document  its  good  faith  effort  to  meet  the  
established goals.  

 In addition to the goal-based policy, it is the preference of the City of Dallas for the workforce of contract awardees to be  
reflective of the diversity of the residents of the City of Dallas.  
  
The  City  reserves  the  right  to  request  a  company’s  affirmative  action  plan  or  equal  opportunity  plan  from  potential  
contract awardees. In addition, if the potential awardee plans to hire additional staff to complete the contract, the City  
reserves the right to request a local hiring plan.  
  
Insurance Requirements  
  
Insurance requirements are included in the contract and are determined by the City of  Dallas Office of  Risk Management.  
A Certificate of  Insurance (COI) must  be submitted to the City whenever a policy expires and is  renewed.  Funds cannot  be  
released without a memorandum of compliance from the Office of  Risk  Management stating the  insurance requirements  
have been met.  Proof of  insurance  must meet the specific terms of the contract. During the contract term, applicants are  
required to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, permits, insurance and other approvals required by law for the  
provision of services.  

Failure to meet insurance requirements will be reported to the Arts & Culture Advisory Commission and is a default under  
the contract terms.  
  
Panel Review Representatives  

To  help strengthen the Arts and Culture ecosystem in Dallas, each awarded organization must  nominate at  least one staff  
member, board member, and/or affiliated artist to the Office of Arts and Culture funding review panel. (See Review Panel  
and  Selection  Process  for  eligibility  details.)  These  individuals  must  be  eligible  reviewers,  attend  a  panel  reviewer  
orientation, and participate in at least one round of adjudication during the FY 2025-26 year. This can include but is not  
limited to: Community Arts, Community Artist Program (CAP), ArtsActivate, or other ad-hoc review opportunities. (Please  

  FY 2025-26 COP Guidelines                                                                                              Page 14 of 19  
                                                                                                                                                                  65 75  

----------------------- Page 86-----------------------

note that this individual will only be able to participate in reviewing the COP process if the nominee is not on staff, and  
may only adjudicate different tiers than the applicant organization, due to conflict of interest.)  

If an awarded organization already has a staff member, board member, or artist on the review panel roster, this fulfills the  
requirement if the individual serves at least once during the FY 2025-26 year.  
  
Logo and Credit Line  
  
It is imperative that the  residents of  Dallas  know that their local tax dollars make  it possible for them to enjoy the caliber  
of  arts  produced  in  this  City.  All  contractors  must  recognize  the  City  of  Dallas  in  the  same  way  it  recognizes  other  
contributors at the same support  level in terms of  benefits, type size on publications, and frequency of acknowledgment.  
  
The City of  Dallas  logo can  be downloaded from our website: www.dallasculture.org/our-logo.  
  
Arts organizations and artists awarded City of Dallas contracts for cultural services  must include the following reasonably  
visible  and  legible  credit  line  and  logo  in  publications,  programs,  press  releases,  season  broc hures,  lobby  displays,  
advertising, and every other mode of public communication:  

“(Name of your organization/program) is supported in part by the City of Dallas Office of Arts and Culture.”  
  
Complimentary Tickets  

Cultural organizations shall  make available to the OAC up to four complimentary tickets per event, program, production,  
exhibition, or other activity produced by the organization to allow City staff or City officials to assess the management and  
operation of City-owned facilities within their jurisdiction and to oversee City-sponsored events. This requirement applies  
to the organization’s regular programming only and not to special fundraising events. Additionally, the organization may  
provide free tickets for promotional activities to the Director for distribution to the public at various OAC facilities.  
  
Receipt of complimentary tickets by City staff or City officials is subject to the  provisions of the City’s Gift Policy for City  
Employees and City Officials, provided in Council Resolution No. 17-0516 adopted on March 22, 2017.  
Social Media Recognition  
  
In social media promotions related to any service funded by COP, organizations may tag the City of Dallas Office of Arts  
and Culture. See Dallas Culture handles, preferred hashtags, and recommendations for social media engagement below.

Arts and Culture Advisory Commission Liaison  

Funded COP organizations will be assigned a liaison from the Arts and Culture Advisory Commission whose duties will be  
outlined  per  organization  needs.  The  liaison  assignment  will  depend  on  the  availability  of  the  Commissioners.  COP  
organizations shall allow attendance by and share minutes with the assigned Arts and Culture Advisory Commission liaison  
for  governing  board  proceedings,  excluding  confidential  proceedings,  to  the  extent  allowable  by  law  and  board  
governance.  

  

ALAANA Designation  

Applicant organizations are asked to identify as an ALAANA organization if applicable. ALAANA means Africa n, Latinx,  
Asian, Arab, and Native American. This also includes Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (category as defined by the US  
Census Bureau). An ALAANA organization is one whose primary intentions, practices, and mission are by, for, or about  
ALAANA  artists, cultures, and  communities.  The  word  “for”  refers  to the  intention of  the  organization to  perpetuate,  
promote, and present art that is representative of an ALAANA culture and people and/or is given form  by ALAANA artists.  
ALAANA designation has no impact on funding decisions by the City of Dallas. However, it does assist OAC in tracking Dallas  
Cultural Policy and Plan goals surrounding diversity, equity, inclusion, and access.  
  

Probation  

Organizations that fail to provide contractual services or meet program eligibility and reporting requirements may be in  
default  of  the  contract  and  may  be  placed  on  probation  per  OAC  Director  discretion.  Failure  of  an  organization  to  
satisfactorily address the City’s concerns within a period of the probation may result in a recommendation of “no funding”  
for the next fiscal year.  
  

Revisions  

Once the contract has been signed, any changes in the project (either programmatic or financial) must be approved in  
advance  by the Director of the Office of Arts and Culture and will require a formal amendment if it affects the contractual  
requirements. The contractor must submit a written request for approval of any changes.

COP as a Multi-Year Program: Planning for FY 2026-27 and FY 2027-28:  

The FY 2025-26 Cultural Organizations Program will be the first year of a three-year application cycle. All new and  
returning applicants will submit a full application as detailed in the FY 2025-26 COP Guidelines above, including a video  
portion and a panel question and answer session. Each year’s Cultural Organizations Program’s guidelines will be  
reviewed and approved by the City Council and may be subject to change. However, to provide applicants with as  
much advance notice as possible, the following processes and scoring for returning and new applicants are proposed for  
off-cycle years.  
  
Be advised that all applicants, returning or new, must maintain program eligibility each year of the three-year cycle as  
laid out in the program eligibility section of each year’s City Council approved guidelines.  
  
Off-cycle  Applications  

RETURNING APPLICANTS: For the off-cycle years of FY 2026-27 and FY 2027-28, returning applicants will submit a  
modified application, which will not include a video or panel question and answer session. All returning applicants will  
instead submit an updated scope of services for the upcoming year, as well as a shortened written application. During  
off-cycle years, administrative scoring and compliance will hold more significance in the applicant review and funding  
allocation process to emphasize the importance of contract compliance, financial compliance, and adherence to Cultural  
Policy diversity criteria.  
  
NEW APPLICANTS: New organizations wishing to apply for COP may be eligible to apply during the second and/or third  
years of the three-year cycle (FY 2026-27 / FY2027-28). During these off-cycle years, new applicants will complete a similar  
application process as the full first-year application of a cycle to include a video submission, panel review process, and  
panel question and answer session to determine eligibility and acceptance into the program. Additionally, even if funded,  
applicants must repeat a full application when the following year one of the three-year program occurs, likely FY 2028-29.

      numbers of staff, they are exempt from staff diversity goals and receive credit for this criterion.

   DATE  January 17, 2025                                                                          CITY OF DALLAS  

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee  

SUBJECT  Resident Vehicle Towing  
  
        The towing of motor vehicles is handled differently depending on factors such as who is  
        requesting the tow and why the tow is being performed. There are two primary towing  
        categories – Emergency Towing and Non-Consent Towing. Emergency tows are ordered  
        by authorized city officials. Non-consent towing is when a private person or entity calls a  
        wrecker to remove a vehicle.  Each of these types of towing is described further below:  
  
        Emergency Towing  
  
        Emergency   tows   are   governed   by   Chapter   15D   of   the   Dallas   City   Code.   The  
        Transportation Regulation Division of the Department of Transportation and Public Works  
        (TPW) manages the permitting of operating authority, vehicles, and drivers for Emergency  
        Wrecker  Service. The following procedure below applies to Police, Fire, City Marshall,  
        Code Enforcement or Parking Enforcement ordered tows.  
  
        The  existing  procedures  and  contractual requirements  are  to  ensure  the  protection  of  
        vehicles that are taken to the City Auto Pound or the City’s 3rd  party vendor for police or  
        parking enforcement ordered tows.  
  
             1.   Dallas Police Department’s Communications Division Process  
                      o   When  the  Dallas  Police  Department  (DPD)  Communications  Division  
                          receives a call reporting a missing or stolen vehicle, the call taker checks  
                          the impounds file. If the vehicle is impounded, DPD will provide the address  
                          and location of the impound yard.  
                      o   When a vehicle is recovered after being stolen or after the car is processed  
                          for evidence, the owner of the vehicle may be contacted by  DPD to pick up  
                          the vehicle prior to being impounded.  
            2.   Notification  Process  
                      o   According to the Vehicle Storage Facilities (VSFs) Notification Process  
                          outlined  in  the  Texas  Administrative  Code,  VSFs must  send  the  
                          first  notification to the vehicle owner within 5 days of the vehicle being  
                          stored, if the  vehicle  is  registered  in  Texas and  within  14  days  if  
                          registered out of state.  
                      o   A second notification must be sent between the  15th and 20th day after the  
                          first notice if the vehicle remains unclaimed. Private property tows require  
                          additional  notifications  to  law  enforcement  within  two  hours  of  storage  
                          acceptance.  
                      o   Notification  methods  include  certified  mail  or  publication,  ensuring  all  
                          reasonable efforts are made to contact the owner.  

                                                            “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                     Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                84 74

                3.   Pre- and Post-Tow Documentation  
                         o    Tow  operators  are  to  conduct  pre-tow  and  post-tow  vehicle  inspections,  
                              including  capturing  four-sided  photos,  VINs,  and  license  plate  numbers.  
                              Those  photos  are  then  uploaded  to  our  vehicle  management  system  to  
                              document vehicle condition and provide accountability.  
                4.  Video Monitoring  
                         o    Our third-party vendor, VMS, for the non-evidentiary lots have 32 working  
                              cameras at both of their locations. The video footage is kept for 90 days.  
                5.   Contract Compliance and Fairness  
                         o    The third-party vendor, AutoReturn US LLC, operates under a contract that  
                              includes      detailed      service      expectations.        The      agreement        specifies  
                              compliance with state and local regulations, including the Vehicle Storage  
                              Act (Tex. Occupations Code 2303).  
                         o    The  contract  requires  transparency  in  all  operations,  including  customer  
                              receipts, fee structures, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Additionally,  
                              all storage facilities must comply with safety and operational standards.  
                6.   Next Steps  
                         o    Staff  will  examine  potential  enhancements,  such  as  requiring  real-time  
                              video monitoring, improving customer access to vehicle information, and  
                              ensuring equitable notification timelines.  
                         o    Staff  will  review the  vendor’s  compliance  history and explore  updates  to  
                              contract terms during future renewals to reflect best practices in protecting  
                              property and rights.  
  
            Non-consent Towing  
  
           Transportation Regulation also manages the permitting of operating authority, vehicles  
            and drivers for Vehicle Tow Service companies operating within the City of Dallas that  
            perform non-consent towing. Vehicle Tow Service companies provide non-consent tow  
            services for compensation to property owners within the City of Dallas under Chapter 48A  
            of the Dallas City Code. Vehicle Tow Service licensees are to adhere to the following:  
  
                1.  Vehicle Owner Notification Process  
                         o    Per SEC 48A-41 of the Dallas City Code, Vehicle Tow Service licensees  
                              shall provide the vehicle owner written notice of the removal of their vehicle  
                              along with how and to whom they can submit a formal complaint concerning  
                              their vehicle removal.  

  
                2.   Pre- and Post-Tow Documentation  
                         o    Companies are required to maintain vehicle tow service records per Dallas  
                              City    Code      that    includes      towing     agreements,         photographs,        written  
                              authorization for vehicle removal and wrecker slips for a period of no less  
                              than one year. This information should be available upon reasonable notice  

                                                                “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                         Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                 85 74

                              and request. Vehicle tow service licensees are required to notify the Police  
                              Department or designated representative of a non-consent tow within one  
                              hour of removing a vehicle. As part of the notification, they are to supply the  
                              date, time, description, and original location of the vehicle along with trade  
                              name of the tow company and location of the vehicle storage facility.  Upon  
                              delivering the vehicle to a vehicle storage facility, the licensee shall provide  
                              the same information, along with a tow receipt number received from the  
                              Police Department. The vehicle storage facility shall report the acceptance  
                              of the towed vehicle to the Dallas Police Department within two hours of  
                              acceptance.  
                3.  Video Monitoring  
                          o   Though photographs are a requirement as part of the company’s vehicle  
                              tow  service  record,  Transportation  Regulation  does  not  currently  require  
                              that  licensees  capture  video  of  a  vehicle’s  movement  while  in  their  
                              possession, nor photos of the vehicle once delivered to the vehicle storage  
                              facility.  
                4.   Contract Compliance and Fairness  
                          o   As with emergency tows, the City’s third-party vendor, AutoReturn US LLC,  
                              manages records of all non-consent reported tows.  
                5.   Next Steps  
                          o   Staff  will  review  potential  ordinance  amendments,  including  adding  a  
                              requirement of video monitoring of vehicles in route to the storage facility.  
                              Staff  will  also  investigate  current  licensee-initiated  notification  of  tow  to  
                              vehicle owner in an effort to improve process.  
  
            Please let me know if you would like staff to include additional areas in our next steps  
            review. A follow-up report with recommendations will be provided to the Quality of Life,  
            Arts, and Culture Committee at the next scheduled meeting.  
  
            If  you  have  any  questions  or  concerns  regarding  emergency  towing,  please  contact

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts, and Culture Committee  

  
  
         National League of Cities - Cities Addressing Fines and Fees Equitably:  
SUBJECT  

         Sustainability Grant Fund and Assistance Program (Program) Approval  
          
          
         In May 2020, the City of Dallas was selected as one of ten jurisdictions across the country  
         to participate in the inaugural Cities and Counties for Fine and Fee Justice Cohort (Cohort)  
         facilitated by PolicyLink, the City of San Francisco’s Financial Justice Project, and the  
         Fines and Fees Justice Center, each nationally recognized for their work in advancing  
         racial and economic equity through research and advocacy. Selection and participation  
         in  the  Cohort  included  a  $50,000  grant  and  an  18-month  program  to  receive  technical  
         expertise and guidance from jurisdictions and thought leaders with experience in fine and  
         fee reform.  
          
         In 2022, the City adopted the first citywide Racial Equity Plan (REP) to address disparities  
         that historically disadvantaged communities experience. In alignment with the REP the  
         City was awarded Cities Addressing Fines and Fees (CAFFE) Sustainability Grant and  
         Assistance Program grant and technical assistance to strengthen the financial security of  
         families who are at risk of losing income and assets. As recipient the City continued to  
         work  towards  closing  Dallas’  Equity  Indicators  -  40:  Fines  and  Fees  (60).  Data  has  
         demonstrated that  Communities below  I-30 have  higher occurrences  of  receiving  civil  
         citations. 42% of non-payment citations are from five zip codes: 75216 (Council District  
         (CD) 5), 75217 (CD 3), 75241 (CD 4), 75212 (CD 3), and 75211 (CD 4).  
          
         On October 29, 2024, the NLC invited Cities from the CAFFE Cohort to be part of its new  
         Cities  Addressing  Fines  and  Fees  Equitably  (CAFFE) Initiative  program  scaling  pass-  
         through  grants  to  the  CAFFE  cohort  cities,  later called  CAFFE  Initiative  Sustainability  
         Mini-Grant Fund. This opportunity is a testament to the importance of the City’s role in  
         addressing the adverse effects and harmful economic impact that debt can have on lower-  
         income residents. The Office of Equity and Inclusion, in collaboration with key internal  
         City of Dallas departments and stakeholders, will continue to use the CAFFE Initiative's  
         assistance to address inequities in fines and fees.  
          
         The following item (AIS 25-129) is scheduled to appear on the January 22, 2024, agenda  
         to be considered by City Council:  
          
                   Authorize  the  City  Manager  to:  (1)  approve  Cities  Addressing  Fines  and  Fees  
                   (CAFFE)  Sustainability  Grant  and  Assistance  Program  (Program),  as  shown  in  
                   Exhibit A, to provide financial support in the form of grants to the  Fines and  Fees  
                   Assistance Program for eligible recipients related to unpaid fines and fees without  

                                                                  “Service First, Now!”

What We Do:  

 Thanks-Giving Square stands at the heart of Dallas’ cultural and civic life,  
 fostering a community built on gratitude, connection, and shared purpose.  
 Committed to shaping a more caring and inclusive society, we strive to  
 address five key social challenges—  
 1.   Expanding our circle of care  
 2.   Fostering civility  
 3.   Embracing differences  
 4.   Championing socioeconomic mobility  
 5.   Celebrating virtue and goodwill  
 Through this mission, we aim to inspire a movement that defines a new  
 cultural ideal for Dallas and gives each of us a noble role in achieving it.

                      “Once in the Life of a Great City Opportunity”  

The Case for Support of The Thanks-Giving District  
•    Rising downtown property values generate increased property taxes (see Klyde Warren Park, AT&T Discovery District)  
•    Increased downtown tourism drives sales to downtown businesses and increased sales tax to COD  
•    Increased downtown tourism drives hotel nights and Hotel Occupancy Tax to COD and others  
•    Alignment with Downtown Dallas 360 Plan  
•    Downtown Dallas becomes more “walkable” and therefore more desirable  
•    Downtown Dallas attractions become more “connected” and therefore more desirable  
•    Improved quality-of-life for downtown residents and workers  
•    Increased prosperity attracts new businesses (hotels, restaurants, retail, grocery, etc)  
•    Renewal of downtown infrastructure as part of project  
•    Theme of welcoming, belonging and gratitude positively impact the culture (and quality-of-life) of Dallas  
•    Theme of welcoming, belonging and gratitude positively impacts the image of Dallas, driving new visitors, residents and   
     businesses.  
  
The “ASK”  
•    We are requesting that City Council and other city leadership offer a loud, enthusiastic and public endorsement of the  
     project to create The Thanks-Giving District at and around Thanks-Giving Square

   DATE  February  10, 2025                                                                            CITY OF DALLAS  

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts & Culture Committee  

SUBJECT  City Facilities Partners Update – Dallas Museum of Art  
  
        The City of Dallas Office of Arts and Culture typically contracts with various Dallas-based  
        arts  and  culture  non-profit  organizations  for  two  purposes.  The  most  common  is  
        contracting  for  artistic  and  cultural  services  for  Dallas  residents  and  visitors.  More  
         uniquely, Dallas contracts with select organizations to provide long-term management of  
        City-owned cultural venues. The Office of Arts and Culture (OAC) will provide a series of  
         monthly  memoranda  as  an  update  on  each  of  our  facility  management  partners  in  
        alignment with the Dallas Cultural Plan 2018 initiative to, “increase transparency in facility  
         policies and structures.”  
  
         Historical Context  

  
        The Office of Arts and Culture has a history of contracts with the Dallas Museum of Art  
         (DMA) under both purposes referenced above. On an annual basis, OAC contracts with  
        the DMA through the Cultural Organizations Program (COP) which provides operating  
        support for Dallas-based arts and culture non-profit organizations for a year-long season  
        of artistic and cultural services and/or events. City Council annually approves both the  
        guidelines for COP and the eventual funding allocation to recommended organizations.  
        On  October  23,  2024,  City  Council  authorized  funding  for  the  DMA  in  the  amount  of  
        $1,073,896 through a COP contract which will end September 30, 2025.  

  
        The City also holds a long-term facility management agreement with the DMA to manage  
        the operations of the Dallas Museum of Art facility. The initial management agreement  
        was executed in 1972 for the management of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts in Fair Park  
        with the general agreement for the DMA to operate the building and the City  to provide  
         maintenance and repair. The initial agreement also requires the DMA to properly care for  
        the City-owned public artworks in the City’s collection whether on display or in storage.  
         Later, in 1984, the DMA constructed and donated the DMA facility in the Arts District to  
        the City of Dallas, which stands as the Dallas Museum of Art that Dallas knows and enjoys  
        today.  
  
        Since  the  initial  agreement,  the  City  has  executed  five  (5)  amendments  to  the  
         management agreement. Below is a timeline with brief details related to each of the five  

                                                               “Service First, Now!”

             amendments as well as key events and actions related to the DMA and their operation of  
             the venue:  
  
                        1972  -      Dallas  Museum  of  Art,  originally  Dallas  Museum  of  Fine  Arts,  finishes  
                                    construction of the Dallas Museum of Art building and donates it to the City of  
                                    Dallas with the initial lease agreement executed with the term ending May 1,  
                                    1991  establishing  the  DMA  to  operate  the  building  and  the  City  to  provide  
                                    maintenance.  

  
                        1984  -   First Amendment executed approving the issuance of $24.8  million of general  
                                    obligation  bonds,  which  amount,  together  with  over  $20  million  in  private  
                                    donations was used for the construction of the DMA museum facility located at  
                                    1717 N. Harwood St.  
  
                        1990  -     Second  Amendment  executed  allowing  the  DMA  to  construct  the  Hamon  
                                    Building as an additional space in the facility. The amendment also extended  
                                    the term of the contract through May 1, 2011.  
  
                        2011  -   Third Amendment executed further extending the term of the contract through  
                                    May 1, 2021.  
  
                        2021 -  Fourth Amendment executed further extending the term of the contract through  
                                    May 1, 2023.  
  
                        2023  -     Fifth Amendment executed further extending the term of the contract through  
                                    May 1, 2025.  
  
  
             2024 Bond  
  
             The Dallas Museum of Art is an important cultural asset with critical investments needs  
             and repairs. The 2024 Bond Program includes $20,014,619 for upgrades and repairs to  
             HVAC systems, fire suppression systems, and humidity control systems. However, critical  
             investment  needs  and  repairs  may  go  beyond  the  cost  and  scope  of  the  2024  bond  
             funding.  
  
             Upcoming Contract Extension  
  
             The  most  critical  item  currently  under  consideration  is  how  OAC  will  address  the  
             upcoming  expiration  of  the  most  recent  contract  amendment  with  the  DMA  which  
             terminates the long-term management agreement on May 1, 2025. OAC staff has been  
             meeting  monthly  with  DMA  leadership  since  August  2024  to  find  the  most  beneficial  
             means  for  both  the  DMA  and  the  City  to  come  to  agreements  over  a  new  long-term  

                                                                       “Service First, Now!”

              management agreement of the DMA facility. DMA and OAC staff have determined that  
              executing a short-term extension to the current agreement will set both parties up for a  
              successful contract renegotiation period to find the most advantageous outcome for the  
              City and the continued operation and management of the DMA as Dallas’ world-class art  
              museum and as one of the City’s key cultural assets.  
  
              OAC intends to bring this short-term extension as the sixth amendment to the agreement  
              for City Council consideration on March 26, 2025.
