Exhibit A - Fort Worth Avenue TIF District                                                   FY 2022-2023 Annual Report  

                                             Mission Statement  
                                                       
The mission of the  Fort Worth Avenue  TIF District  (“Fort Worth Avenue TIF District” or  
“TIF  District”)  is  to  provide  a  source  of  funding  for  public  investments  necessary  to  
enhance the real estate market for the  Fort Worth Avenue  TIF District area.  The  Fort  
Worth Avenue TIF District represents the outgrowth of the City of Dallas’ effort to provide  
a model for redeveloping urban corridors to take full advantage of the Trinity River project,  
the  signature  Santiago  Calatrava  bridges,  and  the  undeveloped/underdeveloped  land  
parcels near downtown Dallas.  
  
The Fort Worth Avenue TIF District was proposed in April 2007 to assist the creation of a  
more sustainable mix of rental and for-sale residential property in the Fort Worth Avenue  
area. This shift will help  to  encourage the creation of more owner-occupied residential  
units  and  mixed-use  development,  the  removal  and  redevelopment  of  structurally  
obsolete  apartment  complexes  and  retail  centers,  and  the  facilitation  of  necessary  
environmental remediation and redevelopment of the property near the Trinity River and  
downtown Dallas, as well as better trail and recreational connections.  
  
The City Council established the  Fort Worth Avenue TIF District by Ordinance Number  
26798  on  June  13,  2007.  The  TIF  District  took  effect  on  January  1,  2008,  and  it  is  
scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2029 (including collection of the 2029 increment  
in calendar year 2030  and any related matters to be concluded in 2030).  The City of  
Dallas  and  Dallas  County  are  the  TIF  District’s  participating  jurisdictions.  The  City’s  
annual  participation rates are as follows  (excludes adjustments made after the close of  
fiscal year 2022-2023):  
  

     •    0% in 2008                                                      •    85% in 2014 through 2020  
     •    55% in 2009 and 2010                                            •    70% in 2021 and 2022  
     •    70% in 2011 through 2013                                        •    55% in 2023 through 2029  
  

The County’s participation was 0% in 2008 and increased to 55% in 2009 through 2028.  
   
                                 TIF District Accomplishments  
  
The Fort Worth Avenue TIF District is generally bounded by commercial and multi-family  
developments  along  the  Fort  Worth  Avenue  corridor  between  the  Trinity  River  and  
Hartsdale  Avenue.  Many  of  these  properties  were  underutilized  and/or  deteriorated  
initially. The TIF  District also contains many outdated industrial structures, vacant office  
buildings, sparingly used parking lots and undeveloped land. The TIF District is appealing  
given  its  proximity  to  downtown  Dallas,  the  Santiago  Calatrava  bridges,  the  Coombs  
Creek, stable single-family neighborhoods and planned transit-service improvements.  
  
Since inception, City Council has approved TIF District funding for two completed projects  
and one project under construction, Mariposa  (formerly Villas) at Western Heights. The  
first project, the Metro Paws Animal Hospital, was completed in 2012. The second project,  
the Sylvan | Thirty mixed-use development, was completed in 2015. Cliff View multi-family  
housing development was approved for TIF District funding but was never built.

During the fiscal year,  Mariposa  (Villas)  
at  Western  Heights,  a  130-unit  mixed- 
income  senior  residential  development  
located  at  1515  Fort  Worth  Avenue,  
continued construction.  
  
  
  
  
  
In addition, nineteen significant non-TIF District funded projects have added commercial,  
office, retail and restaurant space along or near the West Commerce Street/Fort Worth  
Avenue  corridor.  Note  that  additional  private  investment  has  occurred  within  the  TIF  
District boundaries that is not included in the chart below.

                                Mixed-Income Housing Summary  
  
Successful development efforts support a variety of housing options. Accordingly, twenty  
percent (20%) of all housing units in projects using direct site-specific TIF District funding  
assistance are subject to the City’s and County’s established criteria for mixed-income  
housing. In the Fort Worth Avenue TIF District, as part of TIF  District funding, a total of  
201 units have been built to date, and 40 units (20%) are currently set-aside as affordable.   
  
Mariposa (previously Villas)  at Western Heights,  currently under construction, is a  130  
unit  mixed-income  senior  residential  development.  The  low-income  housing  tax  credit  
project will include 104 (80%) affordable units, including 11 units set aside at 30% of the  
Area Median  Family  Income (AMFI), 42 units set aside at 50% AMFI,  and 51 units set  
aside at 60% AMFI.  
  
                                             TIF District Initiatives  
  
The City and community partners have several initiatives within and adjacent to the TIF  
District.  Collectively, over  $895  million in bond, grant, federal  and private funds will be  
spent on the projects which are expected to help accomplish the following:  
  
     •     Facilitate new mixed-use development in the area  
            
     •     Create a vibrant neighborhood along the Fort Worth Avenue corridor  
            
     •     Increase  recreational opportunities  and connections to the Trinity River corridor  
           and downtown

     •    The  West  Dallas  Signature  Point  project  was  selected  for  funding  through  the  
          North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) Regional Transportation  
          Council’s  Sustainable  Development  Program  Call  for  Projects  in  2005.  This  
          planning  project  used  the  goals  and  standards  established  in  the  West  Dallas  
          Urban  Structure  and  Guidelines  to  create  a  redevelopment  and  investment  
          strategy  for  prioritizing  capital  improvement  projects  in  the  West  Dallas  area  
          bounded by Singleton Boulevard (north), the Trinity River levee (east), I-30 (south)

     •    In  2011,  the  City’s  Park  and  Recreation  Department  completed  an  $8  million  
          renovation of the Stevens Park Golf Course which is adjacent to the TIF  District.   
          Renovations  included  1) erosion control for Coombs Creek;  2) renovation of the  
          golf  course  to  include  drainage,  bridge  construction,  cart  paths;  3)  irrigation  
          improvements; and 4) construction of a maintenance facility.

          improvements   at   the   North   Beckley   Avenue   and   West   Commerce   Street  
          intersection in FY 2015. The $7.8 million project improved pedestrian and bicycle  
          access  to  the  Trinity  River  corridor;  upgraded  storm  sewer,  water  and  sanitary  
          sewer systems; and augmented wider sidewalks, street trees, street furniture, bike  
          lanes and enhanced pedestrian lighting. The project also reused storm water runoff

          between  North  Edgefield  Avenue  and  Sylvan  Avenue.  The  pilot  project  helped  
          determine the feasibility of a proposed thoroughfare plan amendment to modify  
          Fort Worth Avenue from six lanes of vehicular traffic to four lanes and continuation  
          of connecting  buffered bike lanes throughout the  TIF  District. The thoroughfare  
          plan amendment was approved by City Council on September 11, 2013 .

                 Objectives, Programs, and Success Indicators  
  
The Fort Worth Avenue Project Plan and Reinvestment Zone Financing Plan (“Plan”) was  
adopted on March 26, 2008, as amended.  The  Plan’s defined development goals are  
provided below:   
  

     •     Create additional taxable value attributable to new private investment in projects totaling  
           approximately $1,290,239,340 over the term of the TIF District.   
       

                      The TIF District’s taxable value has increased approximately $756,359,547  
                     since its inception (59% of the goal).  Completed projects  include  several  
                     apartments   (Sylvan   Thirty,   Meridian   Kessler   Park,   Pike   (Alta)                                  West  
                     Commerce,  Alta  Yorktown, Broadstone  Ltd, Alexan  West  Dallas,  Lincoln  
                     Kessler Park, and Magnolia on Pollard) as well as  a variety of retail and  
                     commercial projects including Metro Paws Animal Hospital, 7- 11, Comerica  
                     banking center, Aldi grocery store, and the Sylvan Thirty retail center.  
  

     •     Attract  new,  higher density,  private development in the Fort Worth Avenue TIF  
           District  totaling  approximately  1,033,910  square  feet  of  retail  space  and  9,444  
           residential units including townhome, multi-family, single-family, and condominium  
           projects.  Note that only significant developments are included in this report, and,  
           therefore, the actual retail square footage and residential unit count is higher than  
           reported.   
  

                     Since its inception,  192,598 square feet of retail space has been completed  
                     within the TIF District. This represents  18.6% of the goal.  
  
                     Residential   development   continues   to   grow   the                               TIF   District   area’s  
                     population with 2,651 residential units completed, representing 28.1% of the  
                     goal. Additional significant residential projects are under construction within  
                     the TIF District. Note that only significant developments are included in this  
                     report, and, therefore, the actual retail square footage and residential unit  
                     count is higher than reported.   
             
     •     Focus on encouraging the redevelopment of properties in the Fort Worth Avenue  
           corridor  to  increase  density  and  to  provide  enhanced  urban  design  for  the  TIF  
           District  that  meets the  intent  of  the  Fort  Worth  Avenue  Corridor Land  Use  and  
           Urban  Design  Study  and  the  requirements  of  the  West  Commerce  Street/Fort  
           Worth  Avenue  Special  Purpose  District  (PD  714) ,  adopted  by  Ordinance  No.  
           25898 on February 23, 2005, as amended.   
       
                     As seen in the project list on pages  5 -7  of this Annual Report,  many TIF  
                     District  funded  projects  and  those  not  utilizing  TIF  District  funds  have  
                     increased the density along the Fort Worth Avenue corridor. In addition to  
                     the  projects  listed,  several  smaller  projects,  including  Manny  Rodriguez  
                     Photography,  a  4,620  square  foot  studio  and  a  renovated  single-family  
                     home, add to the interest, density and diversification of the TIF District. All

                                                            City of Dallas, Texas

                       Notes to Financial Statements for the Year Ended September 30, 2023  
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
  1.     The  measurement  focus used for the Zone fund is a flow of financial resources. The  financial  
         statements are  prepared using the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under  the modified  
         accrual  basis of accounting, tax increment  revenues  and interest  are  recognized as revenue  
         when  they become both "measurable"  and   "available" to finance expenditures  of the current  
         period.  Expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred.    
   
 2.      State statute requires  that each taxing jurisdiction remit its ad valorem taxes to the Zone by  
         May 1 of each year (remittance  to occur no more than  90 days after taxes for the jurisdiction  
         become delinquent).  
   
 3.      The  Zone's cash balances are  invested in the City’s investment pool and include amounts in  
         demand deposits as well as short-term investments. Pooled investments and short -term non- 
         pooled  investments  are  treated  as  cash  equivalents.  Investment  income  on  the  pooled  
         investments is prorated monthly based upon the average daily cash balance in each fund.   
   
 4.      The  Zone's Financing  Plan permits expenditures not to exceed $4,334,643  over the life of the  
         Zone  to reimburse the City for administrative costs. The Zone  began reimbursing the general  
         fund in fiscal year 2009-10. Any future remittance for administrative expenses would come from  
         excess cash as tax increment  revenue  increases as a  result of increased assessed values.  
   
 5.     “Due  to  general  fund”  amount  of $199,384   on  September  30,  2023,  represents  the  Zone  
        administration costs for the fiscal year  2018-2019  ($32,515),  fiscal year 2019-2020  ($63,495),  
       fiscal year  2020-2021  ($48,877),  and fiscal year 2021-2022  ($54,497)  that have  been earned  
        but will be reimbursed to the General Fund in future years based on the availability of TIF  District  
       funds. Note that these administrative costs do not include billing to other City departments.     
         
 6.    All project costs resulting in capital improvements that are owned by the City are capitalized by  
       the City.
