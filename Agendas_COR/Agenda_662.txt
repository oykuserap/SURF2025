Exhibit A - Skillman Corridor TIF District                                              FY 2022-2023 Annual Report  

  

                                           Mission Statement  
  
The mission of the Skillman Corridor TIF District  (“Skillman Corridor TIF District” or “TIF  
District”)  is  to  provide  a  source  of  funding  for  public  investments  that  will  assist  in  
creating a more sustainable mix of rental and owner-occupied residential property in the  
Skillman  Corridor.  This  effort  will  help  encourage  the  redevelopment  of  structurally  
obsolete   apartment   complexes   and   retail   centers,   better   trail   and   recreational  
connections, and transit-oriented development near the Skillman/Walnut Hill DART light  
rail station and the existing Skillman/LBJ DART light rail station.  The  Skillman Corridor  
TIF  District  began  on  January  1,  2006  and  will  terminate  on  December  31,  2035  
(including  collection  of  the  2035  increment  in  calendar  year  2036  and  any  related  
matters to be concluded in 2036).   
  
              Skillman Corridor TIF District Accomplishments  
  
City  Council  established  the  Skillman  Corridor  TIF  District  by  Ordinance  26148  on  
October 26, 2005.  In December 2006, the TIF  District’s  boundaries were amended to  
include several Richardson Independent School  District (RISD) campuses to help RISD  
meet changing campus needs as the area is redeveloped. The RISD Board of Trustees  
approved  contributing  the  debt  service  portion  of  future  RISD  increment  to  the  TIF  
District up to $10 million net present value (or a total amount of just over $16 million).  
This financial participation marked the first financial participation by a school district in a  
Dallas  TIF  district  since  1999.  The  City  Council  adopted  the  Skillman  Corridor  TIF  
District Project Plan and Reinvestment Zone Financing  Plan  (the “TIF District Plan”)  on  
December 13, 2006 by Ordinance 26534.  
  
In 2007, a  development agreement with  PC LH Land Partners, LP  (PC LH) for the TIF  
District’s catalyst project “Lake  Highlands Town Center (LHTC)” was  approved by the  
Skillman  Corridor  TIF  Board  (the  “TIF  Board”)  and  the  City  Council.  The  project  also  
received funding  commitments  from  Dallas Area  Rapid  Transit  (DART)  and  the  North  
Central  Texas  Council  of  Governments  (NCTCOG)  for  a  light  rail  station  and  related  
improvements  at  Skillman  Street  and  Walnut  Hill  Lane  along  the  existing  DART  Blue  
Line.   In  addition,  the  project  received  funds  from  Dallas  County  for  infrastructure  
improvements and City of Dallas bond funds for infrastructure improvements.  
  
Infrastructure  and  other  public  improvements  as  part  of  the  LHTC  horizontal  site  
development phase  are  complete. An operation and maintenance agreement for  non- 
standard  public  improvements  was  executed  with  PC  LH,  and  the  Lake  Highlands  
Public      Improvement          District     (LHPID)       agreed       to   partial     assignment         of   those  
responsibilities.   
  
The 20 acres of park land and trails constructed as part of the project were conveyed to  
the City  on March 31, 2011  and named  “Watercrest Park.”  Maintenance responsibility  
has  been  designated  to  PC  LH,  future  owners,  and/or  the  Lake  Highlands  Public  
Improvement District (LHPID).

Exhibit A - Skillman Corridor TIF District                                                FY 2022-2023 Annual Report  

  

Due to the economic downturn  between 2008-2010, vertical development at the LHTC  
was delayed. In June 2011, the City approved an amended development agreement for  
LHTC   that   increased   the   TIF   District   funding   dedication  from   $23,000,000   to  a  
maximum of $40,000,000, subject to certain conditions.  
  
In May 2009, the TIF Board adopted a “Skillman Corridor TIF Strategic Implementation  
Plan” to guide the next phases of development and improvements in the TIF District.  
  
In  FY  2011,  a  development  agreement  with  Audelia  WGK,  LLC  for  the  White  Rock  
Place development was approved by the  TIF Board and the City Council.  TIF  District  
funding  assisted  with  reconfiguring  the  southwest  corner  of  Walnut  Hill  Lane  and  
Audelia Road  into a smaller retail  component of 18,000 square feet  and  infrastructure  
for  17 residential lots. All homes were completed in late 2013.  
  
A development agreement with the  Richardson Independent School District (RISD) was  
approved   in   FY   2011   to   provide   TIF   District  funding   pursuant   to   the   Interlocal  
Agreement  between  the  City  and  RISD  for  stadium  facility  improvements  adjacent  to  
Lake Highlands High School as funds are available.  
  
During  FY  2012,  the  TIF  Board  approved  by-law  amendments  to  reflect  changes  in  
state  law  for  TIF  Board  composition  so  that  only  taxing  jurisdictions  that  participate  
financially can have  representation  and a change in the  TIF design review process to  
have  the  function  undertaken  as  part  of  the  City  Design  Studio  Urban  Design  Peer  
Review Panel. The TIF Board also approved mixed-income housing guidelines.  
  
During FY 2013, a development agreement with WRT/DK Residential, L.P. for the White  
Rock  Trail  Apartments  project  was  approved  by  the  TIF  Board  and  City  Council.  The  
development, now called NorthRock Lake Highlands, was completed in late 2014.  In FY  
2016, the developer terminated the agreement, forgoing the TIF subsidy.  
  
In  2015,  Phase  I  requirements  under  the  LHTC  agreement  were  completed,  and  the  
City began disbursement of TIF  District funding. In September 2015, PC LH decided to  
terminate the remainder of the LHTC agreement.   
  
During  FY 2016, the TIF  Board approved  district-wide  funding commitments  including  
$349,800 in local match funding for the  Lake Highlands TOD Multimodal Connectivity  
Project  (hike/bike trail extension) and $35,000 to share in the cost for a Phase I  Master  
Plan to study and  prepare schematic  design  for enhancements to the proposed Lake  
Highlands Gateway Bridge at the intersection of Skillman Street and IH 635.   
  
During  FY  2017,  a  development  agreement  with  NADG/SHOP  Lakeridge  LP  for  the  
Lakeridge shopping center project was approved by the TIF Board and City Council.   
  
In June 2018, the TIF Board recommended district-wide funding up to $350,000 toward  
median/gateway improvements  along Skillman  Street  near the hike/bike trail extension  
project.

During           fiscal        year         2018-2019,               the        Lakeridge  
shopping  center   project  was  completed,  and  the  
$4,500,630  TIF  District funding  was  paid in full. The  
90,476  square  feet  of  upgraded  retail  space  has  
resulted  in  a  more  than  doubling  of  taxable  value.  
The project also replaced much of the non-pervious  
parking  lot  with  8,000  square  feet  of  public  open  
space.  The  City  of  Dallas  and  SHOP  Development                                                                                                               

were awarded the 2019  Urban Land  Institute’s “Next Big Idea” award  for three of their  
local projects, including the Lakeridge center project.  
  
In  2021,  the  TIF  Board  recommended  district-wide  funding  to  support  dredging  and  
studying Watercrest Park pond at Lake Highlands Town Center. On March 9, 2022, City  
Council  authorized  a  construction   contract  for  dredging  of  Watercrest  Park,  and  
dredging  work  is  underway.  In  2021,  the  TIF  Board  also  recommended  district-wide  
funding for 26 new  City light-emitting diode (LED) street lights and approximately 5,200  
linear feet of fiber optics within the District.  
  
In  March  2023,  at  the  recommendation  of  the  TIF  Board,  City  Council  approved  
amendments to the TIF District Plan (the “TIF District Plan Amendment”), expanding the  
District  boundary,  and  dedicated  $5,551,590  to  support  design  and  construction  of  a  
new  City  park  and  multi-purpose  facility  at  the  northwest  corner  of  Forest  Lane  and  
Audelia Road (the “Forest/Audelia Project”).

                                Mixed-Income Housing Summary  
       
Successful  development  efforts  support  a  variety  of  housing  options.  Accordingly,  
twenty percent (20%) of all housing units in projects using direct site-specific TIF District  
funding assistance are subject to the City’s and County’s established criteria for mixed- 
income housing. In this TIF  District, as part  of TIF  District funding, a total of 217  units  
have  been  built  to-date,  of  which  40  are  required  to  be  set-aside  as  affordable.  The  
White Rock Place project involved TIF  District funding  for infrastructure for  17  single- 
family lots, and previously, on a case-by-case basis, for-sale housing was not subject to  
specific affordability requirements.  
  
A  total  of  1,467  residential  units  have  been  completed overall. Another  439  units  are  
under construction without any TIF District subsidy or affordable units anticipated.

In addition to TIF District funding, there have been other public funding commitments in  
support  of  the  Lake  Highlands  Town  Center  (LHTC)  and  improvements  to  trails  and  
gateways as shown  in the TIF  District Initiatives table below. A unique partnership was  
formed  with  PC  LH  and  several  public  agencies  (City,  Dallas  County,  DART,  and

NCTCOG)  as  a  result  of  the  interdependent  layering  of  funding  for  infrastructure  and  
public improvements requiring coordination in support of the LHTC.   
  
In  June  2010,  NCTCOG  Regional  Transportation  Council  (RTC)  awarded  funding  for  
two  Sustainable  Development   (SD)  Projects   in  the  Skillman  Corridor  TIF  District  
including  the  “LBJ/Skillman  Urban  Planning  Initiative”  (planning  study)  and  the  “Lake  
Highlands TOD Sustainable Development Infrastructure Project.”  
  
The  LBJ/Skillman Urban  Planning Initiative  included  evaluating the  best  land use and  
development mix in the  LBJ/Skillman DART Station area and strategies to  encourage  
transit-oriented  development  (TOD)  and  supporting  pedestrian/bike  improvements.  In  
August 2009, the TIF  Board approved a pledge of TIF  District funding  in the amount  of  
$25,000 as matching funds for the  project. NCTCOG funding includes  $100,000 with a  
required  local  20%  match  of  $25,000  for  a  total  study  amount  of  $125,000.  The  
completed study was adopted by City Council in October 2014.   
  
The “Lake Highlands TOD Sustainable Development Infrastructure  Project”, with  Dallas  
County  and  PC  LH  as  partners,  was  selected  for  funding  as  an  infrastructure  project  
totaling $3,243,000 to expand the hike and bike trail south from the LHTC to the existing  
White Rock  Creek Trail (at  Skillman  Street, north of Abrams Road).  In late  2015,  the  
City took  the  lead on managing the  project  with the  TIF  District  providing $346,800 in  
local  match  support  and  Dallas  County  committing  up   to  $271,000   (net  project  
management costs). The trail extension construction was completed in 2021.  
  
In  June  2018,  the  TIF  Board  recommended  up  to  $350,000  in  TIF  District  funding  
toward  the construction costs of median/gateway improvements along Skillman Street  
between        Merriman        Parkway        and     Abrams       Road.      The     Lake      Highlands        Public  
Improvement   District   funded   the   design   work.   Construction  was   implemented   in  
conjunction        with    the    construction       of    the    trail   extension       project.     The     median  
improvements were completed in 2022.  
  
During  fiscal  year  2020-2021,  the  TIF  Board  recommended  dedicating  $1,600,000  in  
TIF District funds to match the  $1,600,000 available 2017  proposition D bond funds for  
dredging of the Watercrest Park pond at Lake Highlands Town Center with the following  
conditions:  (1)  that  the  dredging  is  consistent  with  Alternative  7A  as  presented  in  
Garver’s Technical Memorandum dated April 1, 2021 (partial dredge of the whole pond  
to  a  shallow  1.5  foot  depth  to  remove  all  sediment  above  the  normal  water  surface  
elevation and dredging of the southern “bowl” portion of the pond to full design depth to  
provide  additional  volume),  with  additional  focus  that  the  northern   portion  of  the  
waterway receive a light dredge so as to preserve natural habitat, (2) that the TIF Board  
will  not   entertain  future  dredging  funding  requests,   and  (3)  that  the  findings  as  
presented in the recommended action are accepted. At the same TIF Board meeting,  
the   TIF  Board   also  recommended   dedicating   up   to   $60,000  to   supplement  the  
professional   services   contract   with   Garver   for   Watercrest   Park   pond                          dredging

Watercrest Park Pond study  was  completed in  2022.  On  March 9, 2022, City Council  
approved  the  construction  contract  to  dredge  Watercrest  Park  pond  which  included  
$1,200,700  of  the  TIF  District’s  $1,600,000  commitment.  A subsequent  change  order  
approved  by  City  Council  on  April  12,  2023  that  compensated  the  contractor  for  
additional  work  required  for  an  agreed  upon  alternative  construction  entrance  and  
staging  area  increased  the  TIF  District  funds  by  $399,300,  thereby  utilizing  the  full  
Skillman Corridor TIF District dedication amount of $1,600,000.

     •   To focus on encouraging the redevelopment of properties on the Skillman Street  
         corridor and the existing DART Light  Rail Station at LBJ and Skillman to increase  
         density and provide enhanced urban design for the District.  
                  In  2009,  the  TIF  Board  adopted  a  TIF  District  Strategic  Implementation  
                  Plan  to  focus  redevelopment  activities  and  TIF  expenditures  including  
                  supporting  the  Skillman/LBJ  Gateway  planning  effort  to  promote  TOD  
                  development   at   the   LBJ/Skillman   DART   Station   area.   A   N CTCOG  
                  Regional   Transportation            Council   (RTC)        funded   planning   study   was  
                  completed        in    2014      to   explore      development          options      and     public  
                  improvements  needed  to  facilitate  TOD  development  around  the  LBJ  
                  DAR T station.  
                    
                  The  Lake  Highlands  Gateway  Bridge  project,  a  $64  million  interchange  
                  reconfiguration  for  Skillman  (incorporating  the  extensive  efforts  made  by  
                  community  leaders  to present an alternative  to  an original flyover  bridge  
                  design)  and  the  LBJ  East  project  is  moving  forward  as  one  project.     
                  Construction began Fall 2020 and  was ongoing during the fiscal year.  The  
                  TIF  Board funded  $35,000  to  share  in  the  cost  with  the  Lake  Highlands  
                  Public  Improvement  District  for  a  Phase  I  Master  Plan  that  studied  and  
                  prepared schematic design for bridge enhancements (completed in 20 17) .  
  
     •   To maintain the stability of local schools as redevelopment occurs in the housing  
         market.  
                  In  May  2007,  the  TIF  Board  adopted  “Skillman  Corridor  TIF  District  
                  Relocation       Assistance/Student            Retention      Program        Guidelines”        with  
                  substantial input from the Richardson Independent School District  (RISD)  
                  and  private   partners   as   part   of   negotiating   the   LHTC   development  
                  agreement.  A  concerted   effort  was  made  at  the   start  of  the  LHTC  
                  redevelopment          to    relocate      remaining       tenants      to   other     apartment  
                  complexes within  the RISD. Occupancy levels  were low at the time and of  
                  the 110 unit relocations specifically tracked in August 2007,  78% relocated  
                  to another complex in the RISD.  
                    
                  In  September  2022,  RISD  broke  ground  on  the  new  Lake  Highlands  
                  Middle  School.  The  3-story  school  will  house   1,500  students  and  is  
                  anticipated  to be complete August 2024.  Phase 2  of the project includes  
                  demolition of the existing Lake Highlands Junior High School.  
                    
                  Current      RISD   enrollment         data     for   FY   2023       indicates     that   overall  
                  enrollment for the eleven RISD campuses within the TIF District is up 38%  
                  compared  to  the  2006-07  school  year  when  tracking  for  the  potential  
                  impact  of  TIF  related  redevelopment  began.  Over  the  seventeen-year  
                  period,  all  but  one  RISD  schools  gained  students,  and  Lake  Highlands  
                  High School  enrollment  has increased 69.5%  since  the 2006-2007 school  
                  year.  Staff  and  the  TIF  Board  will  continue  to  work  with  school  district  
                  representatives to monitor enrollment.

      •     To  improve  access  and  connections  to  the  DART  light  rail  system  within  the  
            District.  
                        The Lake Highlands DART opened  December  6,  2010. The station is  the  
                       first infill station constructed  while DART  Rail is  in operation.  The station  
                       area  was  intended  to  be  incorporated  with  the  development  of the  Lake  
                       Highlands Town Center (LHTC).  
  
      •     To  increase  recreational  opportunities  and  improve  connections  to  the  City  of  
            Dallas trails and open space system in the District.  
                        The  20 acres of park and trails  as  part of the  LHTC  was  completed  and  
                       conveyed  to  the  City  in  March  2011.  Maintenance  of  this  recreational  
                       space         is    handled           privately         and/or   by           the     Lake        Highlands            Public

                       In 2010,  the  NCTCOG Regional  Transportation  Council (RTC)  committed  
                       funding  to  expand  the  hike  and  bike  trail  south  from  the  LHTC  to  the  
                       existing  White  Rock  Creek  Trail  (at  Skillman,  north  of  Abrams).   The  
                       project was completed in 2021.

                        District  Plan  Amendment).  The  economic  downturn  in  the  early  years  of  
                       the  TIF  District  impacted the pace of new construction,  including  delaying  
                       the  build  out  of  the  Lake  Highlands  Town  Center,  but  recent  growth,  
                       including  the  18.1%  increase  in  values  between  2022  and  2023,  has  
                       allowed   for   significant   strides   in   meeting   the   goal.                                    The   total   NPV

                                                     Skillman Corridor Tax Increment Financing District  
                           Notes to Financial Statements for the Year Ended September 30, 2023  
                                                                                   
  
1.      The  measurement  focus  used  for  the  Zone  fund  is  a  flow  of  financial  resources.  The  financial  
        statements are prepared using the modified accrual basis of accounting.  Under the modified accrual  
        basis  of  accounting,  tax  increment  revenues  and  interest  are  recognized  as  revenue  when  they  
        become         both   "measurable"   and   "available"   to   finance   expenditures   of   the   current   period.   
        Expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred.    
  
2.      The Zone's cash balances are invested in the City’s investment pool and include amounts in demand  
        deposits   as   well   as   short-term   investments.   Pooled   investments   and   short-term   non-pooled  
        investments  are  treated  as  cash  equivalents.  Investment  income  on  the  pooled  investments  is  
        prorated monthly based upon the average daily cash balance in each fund.   
  
3.      State statute requires that each taxing jurisdiction remit its ad valorem taxes to the Zone by May 1 of  
        each  year  (remittance  to  occur  no  more  than  90  days  after  taxes  for  the  jurisdiction  become  
        delinquent).  
  
  4.    The Zone's Financing  Plan permits expenditures not to exceed $6,123,084 over the life of the Zone  
        to  reimburse  the  City  for  administrative  costs.  Any  future  remittance  for  administrative  expenses  
        would  come  from  excess  cash  as  tax  increment  revenue  increases  as  a  result  of  increased  
        assessed values.  
          
  5.    “Due   to   general   fund”   amount   of   $223,699   on   September   30,   2023   represents   the   Zone  
        administration costs for the fiscal year 2018-2019  ($49,921), fiscal year 2019-2020 ($50,840), fiscal  
        year 2020-2021 ($69,976), and fiscal year 2021-2022 ($52,961) that have been  earned but will be  
        reimbursed to the General Fund in future years based on the availability of TIF  District funds.  Note  
        that these administrative costs do not include billing to other City departments.  
          
  6.    All project costs resulting in capital improvements that are owned by the City are capitalized by the  
        City.

Exhibit A - Skillman Corridor TIF District                                                                                FY 2022-2023 Annual Report  

  

                        Appendix C – District-Wide Set-Aside Funds  

  

The Increment Allocation Policy for the TIF District allows the TIF Board discretion to set  
aside increment for “district-wide improvements” such as gateways, trails, open space,  
public  facilities,  or  utility/streetscape  improvements  benefiting  multiple  properties  or  
blocks.  The intent  of  these funds is to leverage TIF  District  funds as a  match for other  
funding.  
  

Below are district-wide funding commitments to date:  
  

       •     In 2009, TIF District funding of  $25,000 was  paid  toward the required 20%  local  match  
      for  the  LBJ/Skillman  Urban  Planning  Initiative  that  evaluated  the  best  land  use  and  
       development  mix  in  the  LBJ/Skillman  DART  Station  area  and  strategies  to  encourage  
       transit-oriented              development                (TOD)          and       supporting             pedestrian/bike                improvements.  
       NCTCOG funded $100,000 toward the total study amount of $125,000.  
        

       •     In 2016,  a TIF  District funding commitment of $346,800 was recommended towards the  
       local match for the NCTCOG “Lake  Highlands TOD Sustainable Development Infrastructure”  
       Project, to expand the hike  and bike trail south from the LHTC to  the  existing White  Rock  
       Creek Trail (at Skillman Street, north of Abrams Road). The $3.4 million project is complete.   
        

       •     In 2016, a TIF District funding commitment of $35,000 was recommended to share in the  
       cost for a Phase  I Master Plan to study and  prepare schematic design for enhancements to  
      the proposed  Lake Highlands Gateway Bridge  at the  intersection of Skillman Street and  IH  
       635.  The  Lake  Highlands  Public  Improvement  District  (LHPID)  also  committed  at  least  
       $25,000  toward  the  cost and managing the  process. TIF  District funds have  been  used  to  
       reimburse the LHPID for the completed study and schematic designs.  
        

       •     In 2018, a TIF  District funding commitment of $350,000 was recommended towards the  
       construction   costs   of   median/gateway   improvements   along   Skillman   Street   between  
       Merriman  Parkway  and  Abrams  Road.  The  Lake  Highlands  Public  Improvement  District  
      funded the design work.  Construction was  implemented  in conjunction with the  construction  
       of the trail extension project.  
        

       •     In 2021, a TIF  District funding  commitment of $1,600,000  was  recommended to match  
       the $1,600,000  available  in 2017  Proposition D  bond funds for dredging  of the  Watercrest  
       Park pond at  Lake Highlands Town Center.  Funds were transferred to Dallas Water  Utilities  
      to implement the project.  
        

       •     In 2021, a TIF District funding commitment of $60,000 was recommended to supplement  
       the professional services contract with Garver for Watercrest Park pond at Lake Highlands  
       Town Center dredging improvements to provide engineering evaluations and cost estimates  
      for  up to three  beautification and maintenance-reducing concepts of Watercrest  Park  pond.  
       Funds were transferred to Dallas Water Utilities to implement the project.  
        

       •     In 2021, a TIF District funding commitment of $572,000 was recommended to provide 26  
       new City LED street  lights and approximately 5,200 linear feet of fiber optics in the Skillman  
       Corridor TIF District.  Funds were transferred to the Transportation Department to implement  
       the project.   
        

       •     In 2022, a TIF  District funding commitment of $5,551,590 was recommended to support  
       design   and   construction   the                        Forest/Audelia   Project.                    Funds   were   transferred   to   the  
       Department of Parks and Recreation to implement the project (City Council approved 2023).  

  
                                                                            28
