Connected  Dallas - Client Story  

  
 “Digital Ambassadors assisted a woman in setting up a  
 PowerSchool account and registering her four children for  
school. She was amazed to discover she could track  
attendance and grades through an app. Initially, DAs faced  
challenges accessing the account due to missing children’s  
information. DAs called the school directly but faced delays.  
Another DA found the receptionist’s direct number online,  
secured the needed information, and used their teaching  
experience to navigate DISD effectively.”

                                geography  (e.g.,  Council  Districts,  census  tracts),  allowing  community  members  to  engage  with  the

   DATE  February 7, 2025                                                                               CITY OF DALLAS  

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Workforce, Education, and Equity Committee  

SUBJECT  Upskilling Pilot Program: Security Officer Career Ladder Update  
  
         This  memo  provides  an  update  on  the  progress  and  recent  activities  related  to  the  
         development and implementation of the Security Officers Career Ladder/Series, with a  
        focus on compensation and upskilling.  
  
         Below are the responses to the list of questions submitted by the Workforce, Education,  
         and Equity Committee.  
  
         1. How are officers, supervisors, and security personnel with the same title paid?  Is their  
         pay rate consistent or based on experience?  
         It is based on experience, background, and internal equity.  
  
         2. Have newly hired officers been brought in at a higher rate than current officers with the  
         same title? It depends on the experience and background that they are bringing to the  
         position.  
         It depends on what their background and experience is related to the current incumbents.  
  
         3.  When a new officer is hired, is there any type of pay analysis conducted to ensure  
         equity in terms of income?  
        Yes, the department should be looking at the current incumbents and determine the hiring  
         rate that is equitable.  
  
        4. Are there any disparities in pay between newly hired officers and tenured officers, and  
         how are these disparities addressed?  
        Any  disparities  have  been  part  of  the  analysis  during  the  implementation  of  the  
         Compensation Study Market phases that have been done over the last four years.  
  
         5. What system is used to evaluate pay levels and grades for officers?  
        We  use  multiple  data  sources,  market  data  gathered  from  an  external  consultant  the  
         Economic Research Institute a salary data software compensation tool and market data  
        that we collect.  
  
         6.  Are  there  any  equity  issues  that  have  been  addressed  through  impact  studies  or  
         analyses to ensure experience aligns with salary, and do tenured officers receive cost of  
         living adjustments (COLAs)?  
        Yes, through all of the Compensation Market study phases over the last four years.  There  
         have not been any COLAs in recent years.  

                                                                “Service First, Now!”

            HR Upskilling Update:  
  
            On January  15, 2025, the HR  Upskilling Team and the Dallas Police Department hosted  
            a virtual organization-wide Dallas Police Officer recruiting session. Attendance included  
            68 employees across 22 departments. The top 5 departments in attendance included  
            Dallas  Water  Utilities  (DWU),  Transportation  and  Public  Works  (TPW),  Dallas  Police  
            Department (DPD), Code Compliance (CCS) and Aviation (AVI). Reasons for attending  
            included, “Learn more for myself,” “Share information with teammates/colleagues inside  
            the organization” and “Share information with family and friends outside the organization.”  
  
            The HR Upskilling Team and the City of Dallas Security Division met on January 24, 2025,  
            to discuss a recruitment strategy for security officers. The City of Dallas Security Division  
            effectively recruits to fill officer vacancies from a candidate pool of 60 to 80 candidates.  
            The Security Division is in the process of conducting background checks on candidates  
            to  fill  7  officer  vacancies.  The  Security  Division  participates  in  job fairs  by distributing  
            recruiting pamphlets and business cards. For future job fairs, the Security Division will  
            work to place their recruiting table next to the Dallas Police Department table to showcase  
            the possibility of a career pathway.
