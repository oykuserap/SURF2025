BRIEFING ITEMS  
  
I)   Environmental   Due   Diligence   (EDD)   &   Municipal   Setting   Designation   (MSD)   Programs  
     Overview  
       [Lori Trulson, Senior Environmental Coordinator, Office of Environmental Quality & Sustainability]  
     Attachment:  Presentation  (see agenda)  
     a)   The  Commission was briefed on two programs within the Office of Environmental Quality  
          & Sustainability, including relevant projects and services.  
     b)   Questions/Comments  
          i)   Chair Bazan  
               (1)  Please partner with the commission for outreach and engagement assistance.  
          ii)   Vice Chair Villarreal  
               (1)  Regarding  Jeffries-Meyers,  you  were  asking  for  more  participation  from  private  
                    property  owners.  Was  that  just  in  this  area?  There  are  residents  in  West  Dallas  
                    concerned with lead contamination.  
                    (a)  It is just Jeffries-Meyers  (this is where Racial Equity Plan funding is located).  
               (2)  Please  let us know how you would like private property owners to participate going  
                    forward.  
          iii)  Commissioner Derrough  
               (1)  Please reach out to collaborate on work at Jeffries-Meyers.  
          iv)  David Marquis  
               (1)  Are  you  aware  of  any  properties  that  have  deed  restrictions  prohibiting  certain  
                    types of development (i.e.  prohibiting  residential and requiring retail)?  
               (2)  There is a need for the boots-on-the-ground staff to understand what we’re trying  
                    to accomplish.  How close are we to making sure we’ve reached the people actually  
                    doing the work and made sure they are aligned with our goals?  
                    (a)  The    Office     of   Environmental         Quality     &    Sustainability’s      Environmental  
                         Management System team focuses on this.  
               (3)  We’ll be in the budget cycle soon. Let’s think about what we need to advocate for.  
          v)   Chair Bazan  
               (1)  Let’s  remember  that what Mr.  Marquis mentioned  applies to  City contractors,  not  
                    just employees.  
          vi)  Commissioner Roberson  
               (1)  Lane  Plating  and  Shingle  Mountain  are   located   in  my  district.  After  the  Texas  
                    Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) is  

                                                                                                                               2

                   complete,  what  happens  if  issues  come  up  after?  Has  anyone  looked  at  a  plan  to  
                   protect neighborhoods if a  levee  breaks?  
                   (a)  Dallas  Water  Utilities  (DWU)  looks  at  this,  as  well  as  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  
                        Engineers (USACE).  
                   (b)  With Lane Plating being a Superfund site, it is different. For Shingle Mountain,  
                        the  remediation  has   removed  everything.  The  consultant  tested  the   entire  
                        property. All fill has been removed. When we get the certificate, everything is  
                        done.  
         vii) Chair Bazan  
              (1)  Does     the   USACE       not   bear    any    responsibility     to   conduct     assessments       in  
                   development of the levees?  
                   (a)  Since  the  City  is  the  one  acquiring  the  properties,  it’s  our  responsibility  to  do  
                        assessment and remediation.  
              (2)  Regarding  MSDs,  after  a  property  is  designated,  how  is  it  further  monitored  to  
                   ensure any contamination doesn’t leave the site?  
                   (a)  MSD  is  the  step  to  get  closure.  Once  TCEQ  closes  it,  there’s  no  additional  
                        monitoring.  Migration  analysis  is  conducted  during  the  risk  assessment.  As  a  
                        part of the application, we ask if the plume is stable.  
         viii) David Marquis  
              (1)  Climate impacts will affect groundwater due to increased severity and frequency of  
                   storm   events.   Are   we   considering   whether   extreme   weather   could   move   the  
                   contamination?  
                   (a)  Our soil is primarily clay-like. It does not move very much.  
                   (b)  There is more rocky soil in other areas of Dallas.  
                   (c)  Generally, TCEQ would require seasonal monitoring.  
                   (d)  It is evaluated whether there is a river or other sensitive receptor  nearby.  
          ix)  Alan Hoffmann  
              (1)  Is testing happening prior to acquisition?  
                   (a)  Yes.  We  want  to  enter  the  cleanup  program  prior  to  becoming  an  owner.  We  
                        want to  understand environmental  risks before buying. We want to know what  
                        the cost would be, even if we  buy no matter what.  
              (2)  Regarding migration, are any adjacent plats being tested?  
                   (a)  If  we’ve  assessed  it  and  there  is  contamination,  that  would  be  assessed  in  a  
                        cleanup  program.  If  an  MSD  is used,  it would restrict shallow use of the water.  
                        That would be any water even leaving that site.   
                   (b)  We focus on the individual site.  
              (3)  Suggest that if we have a really dirty site, that we would look at adjacency.  
         x)   Mikel Wilkins  
              (1)  Where does the contaminated fill go?  
                   (a)  To  a  landfill that accepts  that type of waste.  It has to meet the landfill’s  permit  
                        requirements. Fill from Shingle Mountain went to McCommas Bluff Landfill.  

                                                                                                                          3

         i)   Commissioner Hiromoto  
              (1)  The City’s energy provider already uses Green Button. Would we get data related to  
                  whether or not the projects sign onto that program?  
                   (a)  Regarding     the   U.S.  Environmental       Protection     Agency     (EPA)    Energy    Star  
                       Portfolio     Manager,     we    should    discuss    this   with    the   Building    Services  
                       Department. They say it’s comparable to Green Button. We can discuss further.  
                   (b)  Vivian Loftness should be looped into this, as she is an expert.  
         ii)  Commissioner Lachman  
              (1)  Is there anything in the standards that  interface with the  Racial Equity  Plan?  
                   (a)  Equity is a key component of scoring. The Office of Equity & Inclusion and Bond  
                       & Construction Management have done analysis on this.  
              (2)  W hen talking about air quality, are we talking about  indoor and outdoor?  
                   (a)  We  do  focus  on  indoor,  though  not  as  much  as  outdoor.  There  are  HVAC  
                       upgrades.  
                   (b)  Through  the process  of certification  under  LEED  Gold, there  are requirements  
                       for  indoor air quality.  
         iii)  Alan Hoffmann  
              (1)  Energy Star  has indoor standards too, especially in their net zero program.  
         iv)  Commissioner Roberson  
              (1)  Are there any projects  related to septic tanks  included?  
                   (a)  There are elements related to stormwater, flood, and erosion controls.  
                   (b)  This would be handled through streets proposition for unimproved streets. This  
                       includes water and sewer.  
         v)   Commissioner Derrough  
                   (a)  Concerns over flooding in District 7. Are there any related projects near Hatcher  
                       St., Elsie Faye Heggins St., Scyene Rd., or Dolphin Rd.?   
                       (i)  It depends on the recommendation that Council approves. We can see if this  
                            is on any of the recommendations.  
                   (b)  This may  be addressed with Mill Creek Drainage Tunnel  Project.  
                   (c)  Council approves which projects move forward. They will discuss this soon.  
         vi)  David Marquis  
              (1)  Keep in mind DWU can issue revenue bonds.  
         vii) Chair Bazan  
              (1)  Interested  in a briefing on status of the Sustainable Procurement Policy.  

                                                                                                                       4

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION STRATEGIC PLANNING WORKSHOP  
January 27, 2024  

All Commission Discussion  
  
The commission discussed ground rules, reviewed  background materials, and deliberated desired  
outcomes.  
                       
Committee Breakouts  
  
Each of the 5 subcommittees separated into groups to develop up to 3 priorities for the year in line  
with the CECAP FY24 Implementation Work Plan and the PTE Committee priorities.  
  
Committee Report-outs  
  
     •    Outreach  & Engagement  (O&E): “Create  inclusive, two-way community communication  
           and support community-led accountability related to environmental issues.”  
                o    Goal 1: Support every commissioner in hosting at least one community  meeting in  
                     their district before the end of 2024.  
                              This includes development of a  questionnaire  including  names of known  
                               partners, venues, and challenges.  
                              This also includes c reation of a "meeting in a box" toolkit with a PowerPoint  
                               and outreach materials.   
                              Conduct an end-of-year engagement audit.  
                                     •   Who  are  we  reaching  and  not reaching?  Identify opportunities for  
                                          more equitable outreach.  
                o    Goal 2: Generate awareness through digital platforms.  
                              Create one post a month of content each commissioner can share on their  
                               own  personal channels  (includes an image, graphic and caption), which will  
                               be distributed through the Board Coordinator. These can be shared on social  
                               media, in newsletters, on Nextdoor, etc.  
                              Collaborate with  subcommittees  on  content  ideas  related  to  what  each  
                               subcommittee is working on and/or topics that are pertinent to them.  
  

     •     Implementation (IMP): “Identify and leverage all resources, including data, funding,  
           incentives, and strategic partnerships needed to accomplish the CECAP’s goals.”  
                o    Goal 1:  Review the sustainable procurement policy.  
                              Remove barriers; improve execution and follow-through.  
                               Identify loopholes that allow procurement of goods and services that are not  
                               compliant with this policy.  
                              Prioritize and recommend changes that include mandates.  
                              Coordinate with the O&E Subcommittee to educate staff and contractors.  
                              Quarterly goals  

                                                                                                                                      2

                                  •   Q1:   Gather   information;  research   the           sustainable   procurement  
                                       policy.  
                                  •   Q2: Prioritize recommendations.

              o    Goal 1: Improve indoor air quality by improving weatherization through integrated  
                   business education and partnership development.  
                           Impact: Number of businesses engaged.  
                           Relevance: Improved weatherization decreases greenhouse gas emissions.  
                           Quarterly goals  
                                 •   Q1: Reach out to OEQS to identify target businesses.  
                                 •   Q2: Research weatherization programs.  
                                 •   Q3 – Q4: Educate businesses on these programs.  
              o    Goal 2: Strengthen the City of Dallas Environmental Justice Screening Tool  (under  
                   development) and the Dallas Community Air Management Program (D-CAMP) with  
                   greater   data   integration  and   partnerships  with   hospital  systems   and   higher  
                   education.  
                           Quarterly goals  
                                 •   Q1: Reach out to OEQS to establish target partnerships, establish a  
                                     protocol for outreach, and engage outside stakeholders.  
                                 •   Q2: Look for 4 institutions to partner with; get at least 1 to engage.  
                                 •   Q3: Develop an implementation plan.  
                                 •   Q4: Begin implementing.  
                                       
     •   Strategic Partnerships & Innovation (SPI):  “Identify and leverage all resources, including  
         data, funding, incentives, and strategic partnerships needed to  accomplish the CECAP’s  
         goals. Transform the City of Dallas into a hub for environmental innovation.”  
              o    Prior to the workshop, the SPI  Subcommittee took a survey to identify interests,  
                   technical knowledge, and relationships to help engage  the  private sector on  the  
                   topics of  Buildings, Renewable Energy, Alternate Fuel Infrastructure (within the  
                   Transportation goal). Upon reviewing the survey results, the group highlighted 3  
                   potential priority actions from the FY24 CECAP Implementation Work Plan:   
                           B13: Establish urban greening factor requirements for new developments  
                            that   quantify  how   projects  contribute  to   urban  greening  for   reduced  
                            stormwater runoff and urban heat island improvements.   
                           B15: Evaluate potential city-owned properties for the creation of ‘resilience  
                            hubs.’   
                           E5: Build regional strategic partnerships to promote adopting renewable  
                            energy (rooftop solar).   
              o    The group decided to focus on incentives to motivate the private sector to realize  
                   meaningful   positive       change     in   action   B13     (urban    greening),     which   easily  
                   encompasses 6  of the  8  CECAP goals. This focus will allow alignment with other  
                   subcommittee goals (EHC and EJ), with ongoing work by City of Dallas departments  
                   (like the ForwardDallas plan), and with other regional organizations.

Memorandum  
  
To: City of Dallas Environmental Commission                                                                                                             
  
From: Heather Bullock, Lights Out Dallas Assistant Coordinator, Texas Conservation Alliance  
  
Date: March 1, 2024  
  
Subject: Recommending adoption of an ordinance supporting Lights Out DFW  
  
Lights Out DFW is seeking the support of the City of Dallas Environmental Commission in recommending a  
lighting ordinance based on the International Dark Sky Association’s Five Principles for Responsible  
Outdoor Lighting to reduce light pollution and its harmful effects on wildlife and humans.    
  
About Lights Out DFW: Lights Out DFW is a campaign run by the Texas Conservation Alliance to reduce  
the impact of light pollution and building design on migratory birds and other wildlife through advocacy,  
education, and bird-building collision surveys. Lights Out DFW is part of Lights Out Texas, a statewide  
coalition of partners coordinated by Audubon Texas and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology that is dedicated  
to the conservation of birds. A list of partners, previous proclamations, and more information can be found  
on the Lights Out Texas website and Lights Out DFW website.  
  
Benefits of Going Lights Out: Darker skies benefit birds, which are easily disoriented by commercial and  
residential light emanating from communities. It’s estimated nearly 1 billion birds die annually due to  
collisions with buildings. Fortunately, a simple thing like turning out lights can help birds navigate our  
environment and protect them from unnecessary harm. A landmark study conducted by the Field Museum in  
Chicago showed that by turning the lights off in one building, bird fatalities dropped by more than 80  
percent.  
In addition to helping birds, turning off non-essential lights saves money and conserves energy for cities,  
local businesses, and homeowners. A Lights Out program will make Dallas more bird-friendly while also  
supporting sustainability goals. Reducing artificial light at night (ALAN) also increases human health and  
well-being, as ALAN disrupts people’s circadian rhythms and sleep.     
   
                                                                                                             st 
Additional Ways to Support Lights Out DFW: Spring migration began on March 1  this year and  
                                  th                  nd              th 
continues through June 15  , with April 22               – May 12   being the peak migration period. Here’s how can  
we use your support:  
      •    Helping us pass a proclamation or resolution recognizing the priority to go Lights Out for Bird  
           during spring and fall migration;  
      •    Share the Lights Out Dallas season announcement via applicable communication streams  
           (newsletters, blogs, social media etc.)  
      •    For the City of Dallas managed facilities,  
           o        Turn off unnecessary lighting from 11 p.m. – 6 a.m. (especially near the tops of buildings)  
           o        Use timers or motion sensors on necessary lighting  
           o        Use down shielding on external lighting  
           o        Dim or extinguish lobby and atrium lighting  
      •    Take the Lights Out pledge!  (and share with your network!)  
    
Thank you for your consideration and support of this request. Many of the major cities and counties across  
Texas, including Fort Worth, Austin, and Houston have implemented and seen the benefits of Lights Out  
programs. Through these simple changes, your support will make a positive impact on the people and birds  
that share our community.

         Regional Public Awareness Campaign – Memorandum of Understanding with  
SUBJECT  

         Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD)  
           
         The Office of Environmental Quality & Sustainability (OEQS) is seeking continuation of  
         the Water Conservation Regional Public Awareness Campaign between City of Dallas  
         (City)  and  TRWD  through  a  five-year  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  in  an  
         amount not to exceed $3,350,000 – Financing: General Fund – fully reimbursed by Dallas  
         Water Utilities (DWU).   
           
         Background    
           
         As  water  suppliers  for  over  5  million  people  in  the  Dallas-Fort  Worth  Metroplex  and  
         surrounding  communities,  the  City  and  TRWD  have  a  keen  interest  in  the  wise  and  
         efficient use of the regional water supply.   
           
         In 2009, the City and TRWD began working together on the development and funding of  
         a regional campaign. The two parties first executed a  MOU in 2014 which was updated  
         in 2019. The campaign also expanded its reach in 2019 with the participation of the North  
         Texas  Municipal  Water  District  (NTMWD).  The  Water  Conservation  Regional  Public  
         Awareness Campaign’s goal is to build awareness of the importance of using water wisely  
         and to provide useful tips on efficient water use. The joint campaign launches annually in  
         the summer, as the peak irrigation season begins. Outdoor irrigation is a primary target  
         since it has the highest potential water savings for water customers and water providers.   
           
         The  regional campaign has resulted in significant financial savings and advantages for  
         both entities. By sharing a common message, creative product and media purchase, each  
         entity  has  reduced  its  creative  development,  production,  and  advertising  costs.  Since  
         2009,  the  City  and  TRWD  have  each  saved  approximately  $2.2  million  in  creative  
         production costs and gained advertising exposure worth approximately $11.25 million.   
           
         As in prior years, future creative products for the campaign will include television, radio,  
         on-line advertising, billboards, transit and newspaper advertising in English and Spanish.  
         Additionally, Dallas and TRWD will share the costs to maintain and update the regional  
         campaign  website  (https://waterisawesome.com/)  and  the  regional  weekly  watering  
         advice tool developed as a free resource for customers.   
           
         The MOU requires a campaign steering committee, establishes TRWD as the contracting  
         authority for the creative and media buying contracts, and establishes a cost share for all  
         expenses. In accordance with the “City of Dallas-Tarrant Regional Water District Interlocal  
         Cooperation Contract” Article IV Fair Opportunities Purchasing and Contracting, Dallas  

                                                                 “Our Product is Service”  
                                                     Empathy | Ethics | Excellence | Engagement | Equity

      TO  Honorable Chair Bazan and Members of the Environmental Commission  
            
SUBJECT   Office of Environmental Quality & Sustainability (OEQS) Solar Siting Study   

            

          Background  
            
          In November 2022, OEQS issued a request for proposals (RFP) to seek professional assistance  
          “to guide development of solar [photovoltaic (PV)] generating capacity on City‐owned property”  
          with the results of the study to “provide short‐term and long‐term cost analyses of economically  
          feasible  potential  City‐owned  or  privately-owned  (under  lease  agreement)  solar  PV  assets,  
          emissions reductions associated with those assets, optimal locations for solar PV installations,  
          project priorities and funding options for Council to consider.” The RFP identified the following  
          priorities for this Solar Siting Study:  
               •    Help   achieve   Comprehensive   Environmental   and   Climate   Action   Plan   (CECAP)  
                    renewable energy targets and actions;  
               •    Advance goals of the Racial Equity Plan (REP);  
               •    Reduce energy poverty and support access to renewable energy for low- and moderate- 
                    income residents;  
               •    Minimize negative impact to local natural resources; and  
               •    Explore opportunities to support habitat, pollinators, and other environmental resource  
                    assets.  
                      
          The study advances the CECAP Goal 2 commitment to generate  and use  renewable, reliable,  
          and affordable energy. The Goal 2 targets include the installation of 739 MW and 3,695 MW of  
          solar power within the City by 2030 and 2050, respectively. It also aligns with OEQS’ Department  
          Program Measures in the REP to “[p]rovide access to community solar opportunities for qualified  
          households with the greatest need by December 2025” with the target to “[i]ncrease residential  
          building  efficiency  through  weatherization,  access  to  clean  energy  through  community  solar  
          programs, and reduce energy use in historically disadvantaged communities through other related  
          programs.”  
            
          In April 2023, OEQS contracted with a consultant team led by Ameresco Inc. to evaluate the City  
          of Dallas property portfolio and identify ten priority sites for further analysis. For these ten priority  
          sites, the consultant team was tasked with providing detailed technical and financial analysis as  
          well  as  preliminary  system  designs  that  could  be  used  as  the  basis  for  future  soliciations  for  
          installation of proposed systems through a later procurement. The team was also tasked with  
          evaluating the demographic profile of the communities adjacent to each site and any potential  
          evironmental impacts of solar energy development at the priority sites.   
            
          Project Overview and Approach  
            
          The project team evaluated City properties for potential as building-serving sites and community- 
          serving sites. Building-serving sites are properties with a City of Dallas facility or other energy- 
          using infrastructure where a solar PV system can directly offset consumption of electricity from  
          the  grid  and  reduce  utility  costs.  These  sites  are  also  referred  to  as  “behind  the  meter.”  
          Community-serving sites are properties that could host a solar PV system that produces electricity  
          that is delivered to the grid for use by residents and non-City entities. Community solar typically  
          uses a subscription model where multiple participants subscribe to a portion of the solar energy  

                                                                  “Our Product is Service”  
                                                     Empathy | Ethics | Excellence | Equity | Engagement

                                                                                                                         Page | 2  
  
generated. Subscribers do not receive electricity directly from the community solar system and  
therefore do not need to be physically located near the system.    
  
OEQS staff initially requested five building-serving and five community-serving sites, and sought  
to avoid recommendations to install solar carport canopies as an effort to reduce single occupent  
vehicle   use.   These   directives   were   modified   following   the   team’s   presentation   to   the  
Environmental Commission on October 11, 2023, based on feedback from Commissioners and  
technical advisors.   
  
Ultimately, the project team recommended eight building-serving sites, one community-serving  
site (Dallas Sanitation Department’s Southwest Transfer Station), and one site (Martin Luther  
King, Jr. Community Center) that could be used to offset building electricity use or for community  
solar, but not both due to technical constraints. The building-serving sites were selected based  
on economic and technical feasibility; department feedback that identified key constraints; and  
site visits and document reviews that revealed disqualifying conditions of certain sites.    
  
For  community-serving  sites,  the  team  identified  sites  with  sufficient  space  with  appropriate  
conditions  to  support  a  solar  PV  system  large  enough  to  potentially  overcome  economic  
challenges to community solar and attract interest from: potential community  solar developers,  
who  would  install  the  system;  and  retail  electricity  providers,  who  would  likely  manage  the  
subscription and billing process for a community solar program. The team conducted GIS spatial  
analysis to evaluate sites, which were then qualified or eliminated based on key environmental  
criteria and department feedback.  
  
Community Engagement and Feedback  
  
The project team provided two primary community engagement opportunities: an online survey  
and town hall meetings. An online community survey in English and Spanish was administered in  
Fall 2023. The three-part survey gauged Dallas residents’ awareness and preferences related to:  
     •    Building-serving solar energy development on City-owned properties;  
     •    Community-serving solar energy development on City-owned properties; and  
     •    Residential solar energy options.   
  
The  solar  siting  study  project  team  received  148  valid  responses  (146  English,  2  Spanish).  
Responses were geographically dispersed and somewhat demographically diverse, though they  
likely overrepresent Dallas residents with existing interest and investment in solar. Nevertheless,  
the survey results provided valuable insights that helped inform the selection of the ten priority  
solar sites and could inform potential residential and community solar energy program design.  
  
An in-person town hall was held at the West Dallas Multipurpose Center on February 15, 2024,  
and a virtual town hall was held via WebEx on February 21, 2024. There were approximately 20  
attendees  representing  at  least  seven  zip  codes,  including  three  people  from  two  Priority  Zip  
Codes, and three Environmental Commissioners at the town halls. The project team provided an  
overview of the purpose of the study and the recommended ten sites. The in-person event also  
included interactive opportunities to engage with community partners to learn more about ways  
that residents can take climate action and support solar energy.   
  
Attendee feedback included:  
     •    Enthusiasm  for  the  recommended  solar  installation  at  the  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.  
          Community Center (MLK Center) in particular. The West Dallas Multipurpose Center was  
          also  recommended  by  attendees  for  the  City  to  prioritize  for  early  investment  in  solar  
          energy.

     •    Support for solar parking canopies to help reduce temperatures at surface parking lots,  
          especially at the MLK Center.   
     •    Interest in educational opportunities, including hands-on solar panel installation learning  
          opportunities for Dallas ISD Career and Technical Education students and onsite signage  
          explaining how solar panels work.   
     •    Curiosity about how the City is promoting solar energy for private property owners and  
          City plans for installing electric vehicle charging stations and battery energy storage as  
          complements to solar energy.  
     •    Interest  in  the  procurement  process  and  timeline  for  installing  solar  systems  at  the  
          recommended sites.  
  
Priority Site Portfolio Overview  
  
The  project  team  identified  3.6  megawatts  of  solar  potential  across  ten  priority  sites  with  the  
potential to generate 5.4 million killowatt hours of renewable electricity per year—that’s enough  
to power 420 Texas homes for a year and avoid more than 69,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide- 
equivalent   (CO2e)   greenhouse   gas   emissions   by   2050.   The   nine   building-serving   solar  
installations would produce a combined $2.4 million net positive value over the standard 25-year  
durable life of solar PV. The portfolio has a 7.1% internal rate of return and would reach simple  
payback in year 14. The two potential community-serving sites have the potential to support 227  
community  solar  subscriptions  and  would  provide  a  valuable  pilot  opportunity  for  the  City  to  
develop  a  greater  understanding  of  community  solar  potential  and  challenges  in  the  Texas  
market, where community solar is not supported with an organized program and faces market,  
regulatory, and economic barriers to success. Site-by-site and portfolio technical and financial  
details are enclosed. A map of the ten priority solar sites with demographic and environmental  
context is available at bit.ly/CODSolarSiteMap.   
  
The  proposed  preliminary  designs  and  associated  financial  analysis  is  based  on  “as-is”  site  
conditions observed  by project team engineers or identified in feedback from Building Services  
Department   (BSD)   and   departments   controlling   relevant   properties   including   Parks   and  
Recreation (PKR), Sanitation (SAN), Dallas Police Department (DPD), and Equipment and Fleet  
Management (EFM). The enclosed  cost estimates and financial analysis should be considered  
preliminary and final determination of required upgrades would be determined at the time of final  
system design and permitting. The final solar siting study report will include a full and detailed list  
of inclusions, exclusions, and assumptions that informed the analysis.  
  
The  project  team  recommends  aiming  to  develop  the  priority  site  portfolio  through  a  single  
solicitation. Multiple  procurements for indiviual sites will create delays and inefficiencies that will  
negatively  impact  the  economic  performance  of  the  portfolio  and  delay  associated  emissions  
reductions.   
  
Study Final Report   
  
The project team will submit a comprehensive report detailing study approach, site-level analysis,  
and recommendations on community solar, funding, and procurement in March 2024.

The proposed preliminary designs and associated financial analysis is based on “as-is” site conditions verified by project team engineers through site visits,  
provided building documentation, and feedback from Building Services Department (BSD) and departments controlling relevant properties including Parks and  
Recreation (PKR), Sanitation (SAN), Dallas Police Department (DPD), and Equipment and Fleet Management (EFM). Although the consultant team quantified  
costs associated with standard installation conditions and known technical constraints, the provided cost estimates and financial analysis should be  
considered preliminary. Project team engineers did not observe the need for specific upgrades to building electrical infrastructure or roof replacements however  
final determination of required upgrades would be determined at the time of final system design and permitting. Turnkey purchase price does not include value  
of any incentives. Other financial metrics assume securing a 30% Investment Tax Credit using the elective pay process and Oncor rebates. The final  
solar siting study report will include a full and detailed list of inclusions, exclusions, and assumptions that informed the analysis.

Solar Development Options 

  Building-Serving Solar Sites 

      • Solar panels installed onsite that directly serves the building’s energy needs 

      • Can be rooftop, ground mount, or carport 

      • Avoids use of grid electricity in real time 

      • Can result in lower electricity costs (but it’s complicated) 

  Community-Serving Solar Sites 

      • Solar panels that do not directly serve a nearby building but instead generate  
        electricity for others to purchase through subscriptions 

      • Can be rooftop, ground mount, or carport 

      • Are typically larger than Building Serving Solar 

      • Typically run by a program administrator and facilitated by supportive policy

Study Approach 

              •How much solar energy can this site produce? 
              •Is there a good place to put solar panels at this site? 
 Technical    •For community-serving solar, is there a large enough area to support a community-scale system?  

              •How much will it cost to put solar panels at this site? 
              •How much can the City save on utility costs from solar panels at this site? 
  Financial   •How long will it take to break even (pay back) the solar panel installation costs? 

              •Would trees or other desirable vegetation have to be removed? Would any protected species be affected?  
              •Is there a more desirable use than solar for this site? 
 Environmental •Would there be any water quality impacts?  

              •Does the presence of solar panels at this site affect the users of the site and/or surrounding community? 
              •Are there job creation and/or job training opportunities from putting solar panels at this site?  
   Equity     •For community-serving solar, could community members—especially those with low incomes—benefit from a solar subscription?
