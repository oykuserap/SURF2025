I)   2023 Equity Indicators Report: Environmental Justice Measures Update  
     [Dr. Lindsey Wilson,  Director, Office of Equity & Inclusion]  
     Attachment: Memo (see agenda)  
     a)   The   Commission was  briefed  on  progress  of  incorporation of  the   Commission’s four  
          recommended environmental justice indicators into the Equity Indicators Report.  
     b)   Questions/Comments  
          i)   Chair Bazan  
               (1)  Are  the  equity  indicators being  integrated  as  proposed by   the  Environmental  
                    Commission?  
                    (a)  We have added a sixth theme – Environmental Justice – which includes the four  
                         indicators recommended by   the   Commission (tree   canopy  coverage,  solar  
                         accessibility, food access, and environmental justice screening).  
               (2)  In the recommendations, there were specific components to each of those topics.  
                    Are those details going to be incorporated as recommended?  
                    (a)  We are still working on the food access indicator  and looking at data from the  
                         U.S. Department of Agriculture. As it  pertains to access to healthy food, that is  
                         incorporated in the report. The other measures are included as recommended.  
               (3)  Will the report be shared in January?  
                    (a)  Yes, it should be finalized digitally in January.   
               (4)  Will it be made available in multiple languages?  
                    (a)  It will be available initially in English and Spanish.  
          ii)  Commissioner Lachman  
               (1)  Are there components related to safe and affordable housing / housing equity?  

                                                                                                                              2

                        This was included in the original 2019 Equity Indicators Report and will continue  
                        to be incorporated in the upcoming report.  
                   (b)  Regarding the EJScreen indicator, the foundation of that indicator is data from  
                        the  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  EJScreen and the soon-to-be  
                        Dallas EJ Screening Tool, focusing on air and sociodemographic data.

I)   Update  on Dallas-Fort  Worth Air Quality  Improvement Plan Development  & 5 
     Climate Assessment  
     [Chris Klaus, Senior Program Manager, Transportation – North Central Texas Council of Governments;  
     Susan    Alvarez,   Director   of   Environment       &   Development      –   North   Central    Texas   Council   of  
     Governments]  
     Attachment: Presentation (see agenda)  
     a)   The   Commission  was          briefed   on     progress   of     development   the        DFW      Air   Quality  
          Improvement Plan and release of the 5th National Climate Assessment.  

     b)   Questions/Comments  
          i)  Alan Hoffmann  
               (1)  Related  to  available funding  and the  weatherization aspect of  the  plan,  radiant  
                   barrier is a low-cost item that has a high impact in reducing heat load in the summer.  
                   This is something that could happen quickly and  have a large impact. Suggest the  
                   Office of Environmental Quality & Sustainability (OEQS) do an analysis on what the  
                   carbon reduction would be to implement a related program for single-family homes.  
                   (a)  The   weatherization  idea   is  on  the   list.   Some  local  governments  have   the  
                        resources but not the money to implement this, and vice versa. This is high on  
                        the list, but it’s a matter of what to suggest to the EPA as the dollar amount.   
          ii)  Commissioner Wallace  
               (1)  The  City  of  Dallas  is  conducting an  energy  efficiency  pilot. The  Dallas County  
                   Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) is administered by the county and they  
                   have only one contractor. Things like this need to be addressed. We  need to decide  
                   what  entity   is  going  to  provide  this  program. A  huge  portion is  education and  
                   outreach. The best way to do that is via community organizations. There is a backlog  
                   in the WAP process. We need to f igure out more effective systems. Radiant barrier  
                   will reduce electric costs. We need to focus on a comprehensive, intentional system  
                   of funneling graduates of local school districts into green careers.  
          iii)  Dr. Afolabi  
               (1)  Regarding disadvantaged communities, what specifically are you looking for in those  
                   communities? Do those communities have outcomes that they want to reach?  
                   (a)  We need to hear directly from residents on what they want incorporated into  
                        the  plan. We’re  looking  at transportation (last-mile; environmentally friendly  

                                                                                                                            3

                       vehicles), weatherization, and solar. We’re looking at the food nexus. We have  
                        community gardens on the list, but they don’t necessarily fill the food gap in the  
                        supply chain. It could be as simple as using the tools we have (e.g. EJScreen). We  
                        could subgrant out to a local government and they could figure out metrics.  
              (2)  The term “disadvantaged communities” is defined by the federal government  and  
                   includes certain Justice40 requirements.  
         iv)  Rita Beving  
              (1)  On the calendar, I saw mention of a second listening session in January. Do you have  
                   an exact date for that?  
                   (a)  We may not yet  but we’ll work with our community outreach department to get  
                        everything lined up.  
              (2)  A re the planning meetings with stakeholders open to the public?  
                   (a)  Yes.  
                
II)   City of Dallas Brownfields Redevelopment  Program  
     [Ngozi  Nwosu,  Brownfields   Program Manager,  Office  of  Environmental  Quality  &  Sustainability;  
     Amany     Abu-Hijlih,    Brownfields     Program      Coordinator,     Office   of   Environmental       Quality   &  
     Sustainability]   
     Attachment: Presentation (see agenda)  
     a)   The  Commission was briefed on  an  overview  and  accomplishments  of the Brownfields  
         Redevelopment Program.  
     b)   Questions/Comments  
         i)   Commissioner Derrough  
              (1)  Most sites in the target boundary are in District 7.   
              (2)  Does the City apply for the grant for the property owner?  
                   (a)  The City applied for the grant. The site can only be nominated by the site owner.  
              (3)  Does the owner have to pay it back?  
                   (a)  Only if they borrow a loan. If they need an assessment, that is covered by the  
                        City. If they need the  Revolving Loan Fund grant in the form of a subgrant, that  
                        is covered by the  City. If they need it in the form of a loan, they need to pay it  
                        back (low interest).  
              (4)  Would like to be connected for updates on these sites.  
                   (a)  The site can only be applied for by the owner; there  is only limited information  
                       we can share.  Updates are also on our website. We are available to present at  
                        community meetings.  
         ii)  Chair Bazan  
              (1)  Can we  get  quarterly updates on  the  status of these  five  sites  as  they  progress  
                   through the program (to the extent of what we can share)? The next update should  
                   be provided in April.  
         iii)  Commissioner Wallace  
              (1)  Have you reached out to affordable housing developers in these areas?  

                                                                                                                         4

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION MEETING MINUTES  
December 13, 2023  

                   (a)  Our   outreach  list   includes  developers.  We   work   with  the   City’s           Housing  
                       Department internally, the Planning + Urban Design department, and the Texas  
                        Real Estate Commission. We welcome any other suggestions as well .  
         iv)  Dr. Jack  
              (1)  Please share background information related to selection of the target area?  
                   (a)  When  OEQS  first applied for the grant in 2020, there was a survey done that  
                       took  into consideration  the  equity index.  We  looked at  housing, health,  and  
                       environmental data in the area.  We prioritized the target area, but if there is  
                       another area in the geographic boundary that needs assessment, we’ll look at it.  
         v)   Vice Chair Villarreal  
              (1)  Please provide specifics on how this is  different from the  Texas  Commission on  
                   Environmental Quality Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP).  
                   (a)  The  VCP  is  not a  grant program. A site  may go  through the  VCP  to receive  
                       directives on how to assess the site and to  receive certification  and paperwork  
                       for background on the property. The Brownfields Program involves assessment.  
              (2)  Could you do both?  
                   (a)  Yes.  
              (3)  How many brownfield sites are? It would be great to see a GIS map/dashboard with  
                   daily updates of sites that used to exist, but that are now remediated. When will the  
                   GIS map be available?  
                       (i)   Soon. We’ll link it on our website. The EPA database information is linked on  
                            the site too.  
         vi)  Chair Bazan  
              (1)  One of the  equity  indicators  is distance to  a  brownfield, superfund, VCP site, or  
                   otherwise contaminated area.  
         vii)  Commissioner Wootton  
              (1)  How is the development of the Community Park at Fair Park being funded?  Is the  
                   City paying?  
                   (a)  We’ll check and get back.  
                   (b)  Updated response:  
                        Redevelopment will be  funded through a  combination of public and private  
                       funds, sourced by Fair Park First. The majority of funds are not coming from the  
                       City    of   Dallas.   Public   funds   for   the    project   include   federal   and      state  
                       appropriations; there is no direct funding from the City of Dallas outside of the  
                       Brownfields  program   and   some   of            the   public   works   enhancements   for  
                       pedestrian safety.  
         viii)   Carlos Evans (OEQS)  
              (1)  Regarding the equity indicator mentioned earlier, the first indicator will evaluate air  
                   emissions data coupled with sociodemographic data. Over time, it is difficult to track  
                   multiple data sets as an  Equity Indicator. Therefore, r ight now, one of the priority  
                   areas is air emissions and tracking that over time.  

                                                                                                                        5

         ix)  Chair Bazan  
             (1)  Would like more  information on exactly what each four Equity Indicators will look  
                  like based off of the Commission’s recommendations.  
         x)  Commissioner Derrough  
             (1)  Do you tell the  property owners to inform communities about what contamination  
                  has been found on these sites?  
                  (a)  When it  comes to  a  private property, the  EPA  and the  state  have  their own  
                      regulations in terms of releasing information. They would determine this.  
         xi)  Chair Bazan  
             (1)  At the Lane Plating Superfund Site, signage was eventually posted  and a fence was  
                  built. At the  point that  it becomes public information, a consideration should be  
                  made regarding making the community aware of the dangers of accessing the site.  
         xii) Alap Davé  
             (1)  Do you have a comprehensive list of organizations you’re engaging?  
                  (a)  Yes, The Brownfields Redevelopment Program has ongoing outreach initiatives  
                      with the following entities:

           i)   Is  there really no risk from unqualified people doing the work? Or is this adequately  
                addressed through the process?  
                (1)  If they are members of Texas Solar Energy Society, they’ve been vetted. They have  
                     to apply for new license each year, so there is due diligence.  
      c)   Dr. Jack  
           i)   Clarify who is conducting these inspections?  
                (1)  It doesn’t change the process for inspection;  it changes the process for  permitting.  
                     This would allow the permitting process to be fully online.  
           ii)  A  couple years  ago  the            NCTCOG  participated in  a  North  America solar effort  to  
                streamline permitting. I wonder if this recommendation was included in this effort.  
                (1)  There are other cities looking to adopt this.  
      d)   Alan Hoffmann

                Department.

History & Mission  

  
History  
  
Resolution 20-688 was passed on May 27, 2020, author izing adoption of the Comprehensive  
Environmental &  Climate  Action Plan (CECAP). This resolution charged the City Manager to  
identify  and  convene an  Environment  and  Sustainability Advisory  Committee  comprised  of  
professionals and community members to  advise on environment, sustainability, and CECAP  
implementation. Additionally, the resolution established that the City Manager will coordinate with  
the Environment and Sustainability Advisory Committee regarding the scope and potential roles  
of  an  official  board  or  commission.  Thus,  a  permanent  Environmental  Commission  was  
established through Ordinance No. 31847 on April 28, 2021. Nominations to the Commission  
began in  the fall of  2021 and a  quorum was  established in  time to  hold the first meeting on  
December 17, 2021.  
  
The Commission has a total of 36 members, including 15 voting members appointed by the City  
Council and Mayor, 8 non-voting technical panel members appointed by the City Manager, each  
with expertise in one area of the CECAP, and 5 subcommittees comprised of members of the full  
Commission  and additional non-voting members  of  the public appointed by  the  Commission  
Chair.  
  
Mission  
  
The Environmental Commission is a group of  environmental advocates and professionals who  
advise the City Council on implementation of the CECAP while supporting equitable and effective  
action to resolve environmental issues as they arise in the community.

FY24 Proposed Objectives & Accomplishments  

  
Objectives & Accomplishments  
  
The Commission’s FY24 priorities will  be guided by the following unified priorities established  
during the Commission’s July 2022 Strategic Planning Session:  
  
     1.   Advance environmental equity by encouraging the city to codify equity into its laws and  
          processes. Equitable solutions should meet the varying need of each community.  
     2.   Prioritize public and environmental health by advancing the city’s Greenhouse Gas  
          emissions reductions efforts to meet the 2030 Interim Target and 2050 Carbon Neutrality  
          Target.  
     3.   Identify and leverage all resources, including data, funding, incentives, and strategic  
          partnerships needed to accomplish the CECAP’s goals.  
     4.   Create inclusive, two-way community communication and support community-led  
          accountability related to environmental issues.  
     5.   Transform the City of Dallas into a hub for environmental innovation.  
  
The Commission will work to support the Mayor’s priorities for the Parks, Trails, & the Environment  
Council Committee. The Commission also plans to hold a second Strategic Planning Session in  
early 2024.
