 BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
•    The area of request is currently developed with an approximately 2,700 sq. ft. one  
     story building erected in 1972 per Dallas County Appraisal District  records. The area  
     of  request  is  currently  zoned  a  GR  General  Retail  Subdistrict  within  Planned  
     Development District No. 193, the Oak Lawn Special Purpose District.  
       
•    The  applicant  is  proposing  to  add  a  drive-thru  window  to  the  existing  restaurant  
     building.  Under  the  GR  Subdistrict  within  PD  Np.  193,  the  existing  restaurant  is  
     permitted  by  right;  the  proposed  drive-through  component  required  a  Specific  Use

The request complies with the following land use goals and policies of the Comprehensive  
Plan:

GOAL 1.1           ALIGN  LAND  USE  STRATEGIES  WITH  ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  
                   PRIORITIES  
  
                   Policy       1.1.5      Strengthen          existing      neighborhoods            and      promote  
                   neighborhoods’ unique characteristics.  
                     
ECONOMIC ELEMENT  
  
GOAL 2.1           PROMOTE BALANCED GROWTH  
  
                   Policy 2.1.1  Ensure that zoning is flexible enough to respond to changing  
                   economic conditions.  
  
Area Plan:  
  
The Oak  Lawn Special Purpose District and the Oak Lawn Plan include the following  
objectives:  
  
          (1) To achieve buildings more urban in form.  
           
          (2) To promote and protect an attractive street level pedestrian environment with  
continuous street frontage activities in retail areas.  
  
          (3)  To  encourage  the  placement  of  off-street  parking  underground  or  within  
buildings similar in appearance to non-parking buildings.  
  
          (4) To promote development appropriate to the character of nearby neighborhood  
uses by imposing standards sensitive to scale and adjacency issues.  
           
          (5) To use existing zoned development densities as a base from which to plan,  
while providing bonuses to encourage residential development in commercial areas.  
  
          (6) To discourage variances or zoning changes which would erode the quantity or  
quality  of  single-family  neighborhoods,  or  would  fail  to  adhere  to  the  standards  for  
multiple-family neighborhoods and commercial areas.  
           
          (7) To promote landscape/streetscape quality and appearance.  
  
While the applicant’s request for a drive-through component to the existing restaurant is  
not completely consistent with objectives one (1) and three (3), the existing restaurant

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The area of request is currently developed with an approximately 2,700 sq. ft. one story  
building erected in 1972 per Dallas County Appraisal  District records. According to the  
applicant, they have been operating the  existing restaurant use since 1996.  Properties  
across Maple Avenue are developed with a vacant car wash and park. Adjacent property  
to the southeast  is developed with a retail food store  and a restaurant without drive-in  
services.  Adjacent  properties  to  the  southwest  are  developed  with  single  family  and  
multiple-family. To the northwest across Hawthorne Avenue, properties are developed  
with bars, lounge, or tavern uses, a restaurant without drive-in service, and an auto repair  
garage.   
  
The  applicant  proposes  to  only  add  a  drive-thru  window  and  ordering  station  to  the  
existing  restaurant  building;  which  requires  a  Specific  Use  Permit.  According  to  the  
applicant, they are not proposing to increase the total floor area or modify the pavement  
on the site. The existing restaurant fronts a major arterial where the various restaurants  
and personal service uses operate as well as on a designated Special Retail Street. The  
Special Retail Street designated on specific streets in the Oak Lawn Area promotes a  
more  walkable  pedestrian-friendly  environment  along  the  streetscape.  However,  the  
restaurant’s  building  orientation,  parking  lot,  pavement  on  the  northwest,  and  lack  of  
landscaping  have  existed  since  1979,  based  on  the  historic  aerial  maps,  prior  to  the  
adoption  of  the  Oak  Lawn  Special  Purpose  District  in  1985.  While  the  drive-through  
component  is  not  completely  consistent  with  the  walkable  environment,  there  is  an

existing  sidewalk  and  an  area  for  a  bus  shelter  for  transit  along  Maple  Avenue.  The  
proposed use will provide the residents to continue to dine at various businesses in the  
area. The added drive-through component to the existing restaurant use will not impact  
the surrounding uses negatively. However, staff recommends a two-year period because  
it will provide an opportunity to reevaluate if the window is detrimental.   
  
The  general  provisions  for  a  Specific  Use  Permit  in  Section  51A-4.219  of  the  Dallas  
Development  Code  specifically  state:  (1)  The  SUP  provides  a  means  for  developing  
certain uses in a manner in which the specific use will be consistent with the character of  
the neighborhood; (2) Each SUP application must be evaluated as to its probable effect  
on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as  
the findings indicate appropriate; (3) The city council shall not grant an SUP for a use  
except  upon  a  finding  that  the  use  will:  (A)  complement  or  be  compatible  with  the  
surrounding uses and community facilities; (B) contribute to, enhance, or promote the  
welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; (C) not be detrimental to the public  
health, safety, or general welfare; and (D) conform in all other respects to all applicable  
zoning regulations and standards. The regulations in this chapter have been established  
in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the health, safety,  
morals, and general welfare of the city.  
  
Staff  considers  the  proposed  request  to  be  compatible  with  the  existing  development  
pattern of the area since the restaurant use is already existing and the applicant is only  
adding a drive-thru window and ordering station. Staff recommends approval for a two- 
year  period, subject to a site plan and conditions. Since the restaurant building, parking  
lot, and driveway  are already in  existence, staff believes the two-year  time  period will  
allow an initial period for the applicant to demonstrate their operation of the drive-through  
use, which can then be reevaluated following this initial period.   
      
Landscaping:  
  
Landscaping must be provided in accordance with the landscaping requirements of PD  
No. 193, the Oak Lawn Special Purpose District.  The request site will not trigger any  
landscaping because there is no increase in the total floor area.  
  
Parking:            
  
Pursuant to Planned Development No. 193, off-street  parking  requirement for a drive- 
through  restaurant  is one space for each 100 square feet of floor area. Therefore, the  
existing 2,690 square foot restaurant, requires 27 parking spaces. Per site plan provided,  
there are 27 parking spaces on site.

Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to  more precisely target intervention strategies in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets.  The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is currently within an “C” MVA area.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
•    The  area  of  request  is  currently  zoned  CR  Community  Retail  District  and  is  
     undeveloped.  

•    The applicant proposes multifamily uses on site.  

•    The  applicant  is  requesting  a  Planned  Development  District  based  on  MF-3(A)  
     Multifamily District.  

•    The request would also remove the existing D-1 Overlay, which would not be relevant  
     to  the  proposed  residential  zoning,  as  D-1  Overlays  typically  apply  to  commercial  
     districts only.  

Zoning History:  

There has been one zoning case in the area in the last five years.  
  
     1.  Z212-327:  On November 22, 2022, Specific Use Permit  No. 2229 for the sale of  
         alcoholic  beverages  in  conjunction  with  a  general  merchandise  or  food  store  
         greater than 3,500 square feet, located at the northeast corner of S. Jim Miller  
         Road and Great Trinity Forest Way, was automatically renewed for a five-year time

STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The forwardDallas! Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the City Council in June 2006.  
The  forwardDallas! Comprehensive Plan  outlines several goals and policies which can  
serve as a framework for assisting in evaluating the applicant’s request.   
  
The requested planned development district  complies with the following land use goals  
and policies of the Comprehensive Plan:  
  
LAND USE ELEMENT  
  
GOAL 1.1 ALIGN LAND USE STRATEGIES WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES  
  
          Policy 1.1.1  Focus on Southern Sector development opportunities.  
  
          Policy 1.1.5  Strengthen existing neighborhoods and promote                                              
                            neighborhoods’ unique characteristics.  
                                      1.3.1.7 Implement zoning tools to accommodate alternative   
                                      housing products.  
  
GOAL 1.2 PROMOTE DESIRED DEVELOPMENT  
  
                   Policy 1.2.2 Establish clear and objective standards for land use planning.  
GOAL 1.3 PROVIDE EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DALLAS RESIDENTS  
  
                   Policy 1.3.1 Create housing opportunities throughout Dallas.  
  
GOAL  1.4  COORDINATE  PLANNING  ACTIVITIES  TO  BALANCE  TRANSPORTATION,  
LAND USE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT  
  
                   Policy 1.4.1 Coordinate development and planning activities.  
  
ECONOMIC ELEMENT  
           
GOAL 2.1 PROMOTE BALANCED GROWTH  
                     
                   Policy 2.1.1 Ensure that zoning is flexible enough to respond to changing  
                   economic conditions.  
                   Policy  2.1.3  Support  efforts  to  grow  retail  and  residential  opportunities  in  the  
                   Southern Sector.              
  

                                                               
                                                           3-3  

----------------------- Page 42-----------------------

Z234-316(MP/LG)  

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT  
  
GOAL 5.1           PROMOTE A SENSE OF PLACE, SAFETY, AND WALKABILITY  
  
                   Policy 5.1.1 Promote pedestrian-friendly streetscapes.                                
  
GOAL 5.3           ESTABLISHING WALK-TO CONVENIENCE  
  
                   Policy 5.3.1  Encourage a balance of land uses within walking distance of   
                                      each other.  
NEIGHBORHOOD PLUS  
  
Goal 4             Attract and Retain the Middle Class  
  
                   Policy 4.3         Enhance          neighborhood             desirability        by       improving  
                   infrastructure, housing stock, recreation, and safety.  
  
Goal 5             Expand Homeownership  
  
                   Policy 5.1         Encourage  a  wider  range  of  well-designed  and  affordable  
                   housing types as a response to emerging homeownership preferences.  
  
Overall, the proposed change advances the Comprehensive Plan’s goals to encourage a  
healthy mix of land uses and strengthen neighborhood character and identity  through  
complementary  development.  It  also  furthers  Neighborhood  Plus  goals  of  widening  
housing options and improving housing desirability.  
  
Necessity for Planned Development District:  
  
According  to  Sec.  4.702,  the  purpose  of  a  planned  development  district  is  to  provide  
flexibility  in  the  planning  and  construction  of  development  projects  by  allowing  a  
combination of land uses developed under a uniform plan that protects contiguous land  
uses and preserves significant natural features.  
  
Planned  development  districts  are  appropriate  where  the  existing  code  may  not  
accommodate a use or a development within the bounds of a conventional zoning district  
or where unique site characteristics may necessitate relief or modification of certain base  
code provisions.  
  
In order to provide relief from residential proximity slope and from urban form setback to  
build multifamily in consolidated buildings, a PD is necessary. If subject to RPS and UFS,  

                                                               
                                                           3-4

 the property would have to be more spread out and would consume more of the site,  
 whereas the more concentrated design allows for nearly 50% of the site to be preserved.  
   
 Land Use:  
   

                                           Zoning                                           Land Use

West                                                                              Retail, single family  
                  Control Overlay, R-7.5(A) Single Family District  

   
 Land Use Compatibility:  
   
 North of the site across Great Trinity Forest, there are multifamily and retail uses. There  
 is an undeveloped property zoned CR to the east. South of the site, there are multifamily  
 uses. East across Jim Miller, there are retail uses and single family houses. The proposed  
 multifamily use is appropriate for both the site and the surrounding area.   
   
 The change from CR to an MF-3(A) base would remove a number of more intense uses  
 permitted at this time by right. These changes would make the property more compatible  
 with  residential  uses  around  the  site.  The  district  would  represent  appropriately  sited  
 density.  
   
 Significant infrastructure qualities of the area make it appropriate for additional homes.  
 The site has access to the major roads of Great Trinity Forest, Jim Miller and US 175.  
 The site also has direct access to the  frequent  bus no.  38  transit route  which directly  
 connects the site with Buckner Station and Ledbetter Station.  It is also within walking  
 distance to area schools and regional parks facilities.

Land Use Comparison:  
  
The requested PD for MF-3(A) uses would primarily limit the existing nonresidential CR  
District  site  to  residential  and  institutional  uses.  The  applicant  requests  a  straight  
multifamily  base  district  for  the  proposed  PD  to  allow  for  the  residential  development  
desired.

Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund.  Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to more precisely target intervention strategies in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets.  The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The subject property is located within an MVA “G”.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
•    The area of request is currently undeveloped and zoned an A(A) Agricultural District  
    with  deed  restrictions  [Z845-372].  The  property  is  within  Tract  II-A  of  the  deed  
     restrictions; therefore, only restrictions one and six apply to the site.   

•    Restriction one  restricts the  maximum  number of dwelling units to 1,375 for all  the  
     residential districts combined.   

•   According  to  the  applicant,  there  are  approximately  465  dwelling  units,  or  lots  
     approved by preliminary plats in all of the residential districts of the deed restrictions.   

•    The applicant  proposes approximately 45 units within this site, which will not exceed  
     the 1,375-unit restriction.   

•    The sixth restriction  states all of the definitions of the Dallas Development code as  
     amended are incorporated into the document as if recited herein.   

•    The applicant proposes to develop a single family community that will be an extension  
     of the previously approved plat adjacent to the site to the northeast.      

•    The proposed single-family development includes 5,000-square-foot lots. The existing  
    A(A) allows single family; however, the minimum lot size is three acres.  

Zoning History:  

There have been two zoning cases in the area in the last five years.  
  
     1.  Z201-330:  On  August  24,  2022,  the  City  Council  denied  an  application  for  a  
         Planned Development District for R-5(A) Single Family District uses on property  
         zoned  an  A(A)  Agricultural  District  on  the  northwest  line  of  Haymarket  Road,  
         northwest of the intersection of Haymarket Road and Palomino Road.    
           
     2.  Z245-122:  On February 26, 2025, the  City Plan Commission held an application  
         for an R-5(A) Single family District on property zoned A(A) Agricultural District on  
         the  south  line  of  South  St.  Augustine  Road,  east  of  Middlefield  Road  under  
         advisement to the CPC meeting of April 10, 2025.

Traffic:  
  
The Engineering Division of the Planning and Development Department has reviewed  
the request. A development impact review is required to determine whether the existing  
public infrastructure can accommodate the proposed development.  
  
STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The  forwardDallas!  Comprehensive  Plan  (2.0)  was  adopted  by  the  City  Council  in  
September 2024 and, outlines several goals and policies which can serve as a framework  
for assisting in evaluating the applicant’s request.  
  
The request is consistent with the following goals and policies of the comprehensive plan:  
  
Placetypes:  
  
Small Town Residential   
  
This placetype allows for primary land uses like: Agricultural, Public Open Space, Single  
Family Detached, Single Family Attached; in conjunction with supporting land uses like:  
Private  Open  Space,  Multiplex,  Mixed-Use,  Lodging,  Commercial,  Office,  Civic/Public  
Institutional, Utility.  
  
Small Town Residential areas represent a blend of rural and suburban lifestyle.  These  
neighborhoods typically include single-family homes, rural estates, and active agricultural  
uses. They maintain a slower pace of development while preserving the community’s  
character. Local amenities such as parks and small-scale retail may be present, offering  
essential services while supporting a connected and self-sufficient environment.  
  
The  applicant’s   request  is  consistent  with  the   characteristics  of  the  Small  Town  
Residential placetype and enhances the sense of the neighborhood.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The  area  of  request  is  an  approximately  13-acre  undeveloped  parcel  zoned  an  A(A)  
Agricultural  District.  Properties  to  the  south  are  developed  with  single  family  uses.  
Undeveloped properties are immediately adjacent to the north, east, and west.  
  
The proposed zoning change is consistent with the development and zoning patterns  
found in the area. Staff is in support of the applicant’s request, since the request proposes  
to  develop  the  property  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  surrounding  uses  and  
supported by the comprehensive plan update Small Town Residential PlaceType. This  
request also allows for the development of infill housing in a manner that is consistent  
with future land uses.

Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to  more precisely target intervention strategies in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets.  The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached  MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is currently within an “H” MVA area.

STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The  ForwardDallas  2.0  Comprehensive  Plan  was  adopted  by  the  City  Council  in  
September 2024.  ForwardDallas 2.0 is a refreshed guide that takes into account how our  
City has evolved over the last two decades and how we should plan for what is on the  
horizon  -  from  our  continued  economic  growth  to  our  long-term  social  vibrancy.  
ForwardDallas is a guidance plan, it is not a zoning document. This Comprehensive Plan  
outlines  several  goals  and  policies  which  can  serve  as  a  framework  for  assisting  in  
evaluating the applicant’s request.  
  
The request would comply with the following placetype and primary/supporting land uses  
of the ForwardDallas 2.0 Comprehensive Plan:  

                                                          5-2

The area of request is located in the  Community Residential  Placetype. This placetype  
allows  for primary land uses like:  Single Family Detached, Single Family Attached,  in  
conjunction with supporting land uses which includes: Agricultural, Public Open Space,  
Private Open Space, Multiplex, Apartments, Mixed-Use, Commercial, Office, Civic/Public  
Institutional, Utility.  
  
The Community Residential Placetype  primary focus  on creating vibrant, family-friendly  
environments.  Community  Residential  neighborhoods  are  the  foundation  of  Dallas'  
housing  landscape,  offering  predominantly  single-family  homes  with  integrated  parks,  
schools, and community services. The plan for this placetype is designed to protect and  
support  the  vital  foundation  of  our  existing  neighborhoods,  promote  new,  walkable  
neighborhoods, and encourage support for neighborhoods in need of revitalization.  
  
The request to rezoning BLK A/7646 Lot 3 is in character with the Community Residential  
Placetype goals.  Although the existing zoning of CS Commercial Service District calls for  
more commercial uses due to the adjacency  to the  Union Pacific  railroad, these uses  
have yet to be developed along the Carbondale Street corridor.  Rezoning this  property  
to R-5(A) Single Family District will encourage the revitalization of residential single-family  
homes  to match the existing home to the north and south of the property,  extend the  
narrative of a R-5(A) Single Family District (as shown to the east), and regain the quality  
of  single  family  neighborhoods  to  compliment  the  primary  focus  of  the  Community  
Residential Placetype  
  
The  area  highlighted  below  shows  the  location  of  the  area  of  request  within  the  
ForwardDallas 2.0 Placetype.

  Land Use Compatibility:  
    
  The   area   of   request   is   currently   zoned   a   CS   Commercial   Service   District   and  
  undeveloped. The request sits on an approximately 6,081-square-foot lot located on the  
  east line of Carbondale Street south of Fellow Lane and  is adjacent to a single-family  
  house (to the south).   
    
  To the north of the property are single family uses and undeveloped land. To the east are  
  single family, church, and retail uses. To the south are office and single family uses, as  
  well as, undeveloped land. To the west are industrial and commercial uses. There is also  
  a railroad to the west that runs parallel to Carbondale Street.   
    
  Since this property is located in a Community Residential Placetype which supports single  
  family  detached  and  attached  uses  as  one  of  the  primary  land  uses,  staff  finds  the  
  applicant’s requested zoning change to an R-5(A) Single Family District to be appropriate  
  and compatible with the surrounding area. Additionally, this request fits into the goal of  
  the Community Residential Placetype and will further the encouragement of  revitalizing  
  residential single-family lots within this area.     
    
  Staff supports the applicant’s request and finds the proposed rezoning to be appropriate  
  for this area as it would not be detrimental to surrounding uses. This compatibility is further  
  reflected in the development standards comparison table below.

Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to target intervention strategies more precisely in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is in an “H” MVA area. The site is surrounded by the “H” MVA area  
in all directions immediately adjacent to the site.

STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The  ForwardDallas  2.0  Comprehensive  Plan  was  adopted  by  the  City  Council  in  
September 2024.  ForwardDallas 2.0 is a refreshed guide that takes into account how our  
City has evolved over the last two decades and how we should plan for what is on the  
horizon  -  from  our  continued  economic  growth  to  our  long-term  social  vibrancy.  
ForwardDallas 2.0  is a guidance plan, it is not a zoning document. This Comprehensive  
Plan outlines several goals and policies which can serve as a framework for assisting in  
evaluating the applicant’s request.

The request would comply with the following placetype and primary/supporting land uses  
of the ForwardDallas 2.0 Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The area of request is located in the  City Center  Placetype. This placetype allows for  
primary        land      uses       like:   Apartments,            Mixed-Use,           Lodging,           Commercial,            Office,  
Civic/Public Institutional in conjunction with supporting land uses that include: Agricultural,  
Public Open Space, Private Open Space, Multiplex, Utility, Light Industrial  
  
The City Center Placetype is a vibrant and dense urban core. This placetype offers a mix  
of  high-rise  offices,  apartments,  retail  spaces,  and  cultural  institutions.  Designed  for  
walkability and transit access, this area fosters economic vitality and serve as hubs for  
entertainment and innovation.   
  
The request for a hotel or motel use is in alignment with the purpose of the City Center  
Placetype.  The  placement  of  this  use  within  the  heart  of  the  city  center  furthers  the  
character of the comprehensive plan by welcoming tourism. While supporting a vibrant  
walkable  and  transit  connection  to  restaurants,  shopping,  and  numerous  activities  
downtown has to offer, this use will fit perfect into the fabric of the city center.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The approximately 4,500-square-foot area of request is currently developed with a vacant  
office building situated on two platted lots. The existing two-story building is approximately  
9,000 square feet. The applicant is proposing to remodel the existing structure and add a  
third story. This renovation will bring the total square feet to approximately  13,500, which  
will accommodate 25 guest rooms and amenities associated with the hotel use.   
  
The property is located in a CA-1(A) Central Area District. Surrounding properties consist  
of  a parking garage,  surface parking lots, and offices to the north  and east,  a  medical  
clinic, SUP No. 2376 for a hotel or motel use (39 rooms), and an office to the south facing  
Commerce Street, and surface parking to the west.   
  
The Dallas Development Code, as amended, defines the hotel or motel use as a facility  
containing six or more guest rooms that are rented to occupants on a daily basis.

Z245-147(TB)  

Furthermore, in a CA-1(A) District, a hotel or motel use that has 60 or fewer guest rooms  
requires an SUP.  
  
The  general  provisions  for  a  Specific  Use  Permit  in  Section  51A-4.219  of  the  Dallas  
Development  Code  specifically  state:  (1)  The  SUP  provides  a  means  for  developing  
certain uses in a manner in which the specific use will be consistent with the character of  
the neighborhood; (2) Each SUP application must be evaluated as to its probable effect  
on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as  
the findings indicate appropriate; (3) The city council shall not grant an SUP for a use  
except  upon  a  finding  that  the  use  will:  (A)  complement  or  be  compatible  with  the  
surrounding uses and community facilities; (B) contribute to, enhance, or promote the  
welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; (C) not be detrimental to the public  
health, safety, or general welfare; and (D) conform in all other respects to all applicable  
zoning regulations and standards.  The regulations in this chapter have been established  
in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the health, safety,  
morals, and general welfare of the city. Staff finds that each of these criteria are met by  
the proposed SUP.  
  
The applicant’s request, subject to a site plan and conditions, complies with the general  
provisions for consideration of a specific use permit. The request is located in an area  
anticipated  to  encourage  the  most  appropriate  future  use  of  land,  and  to  prevent  the  
increase of street congestion. Additionally, the Central Area District is designated as an  
area  of  historical,  cultural,  and  architectural  importance  and  significance.  Since,  the  
applicant proposes to adaptively reuse the existing structure, staff considers this request  
an appropriate use for the location.  
  
Staff recommends approval of this request with no expiration date to the time limit, subject  
to a site plan and conditions.  
  
Landscaping:  
  
Landscaping must be provided in accordance with the landscaping requirements in Article  
X, as amended.  
  
Parking:  
  
Parking must be provided in accordance with the Dallas Development Code, as amended.  
Per section 51A-4.124(a)(5)(B)(i) for all uses except single-family and duplex, off-street  
parking is only required for a building built after June 26, 1967. Any addition to an existing  
building  built prior to June 26,  1967, parking  must be provided at a ratio of one parking  
space for each 2,000 square feet of floor area.  Since the use is proposed to go into an  

                                                        6-5

existing structure built in 1958, no parking is required for that portion of the structure. The  
third-floor addition must comply with the parking requirements of one parking space for  
each 2,000 square feet of floor area.  
  
Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  
understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund.  Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to target intervention strategies more precisely in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is in an “F” MVA area. The site is surrounded by the “F” MVA area  
in all directions immediately adjacent to the site.

REQUEST:                               An  application  for  a  new  subdistrict,  on  property  zoned  
                                       Subdistrict 1A within Planned Development District No. 714,

                                       Purpose District.  
  
SUMMARY:                               The purpose of the request is to create a new subdistrict to  
                                       allow a reduced mix of retail and personal service uses for a  
                                       mixed-use project, to allow live-work units, and to reduce the  
                                       minimum floor-to-floor dimension for ground floors.  
  
STAFF RECOMMENDATION:                           Approval, subject to amended conditions.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
●   The area of request is currently developed with an existing six-story mixed use project  
    that includes 331 dwelling units in the residential component, and 17,745 square feet  
    of retail and personal service uses, according to the applicant. There is also an existing  
     parking  lot,  parking  garage   and  amenity   spaces,  on  property  zoned   Planned  
     Development District No. 714 (approx. 3.227 acres in total size).  

●   Geographically located in West Dallas, approximately two miles from downtown.  

●   This lot has frontage on both Pittman and West Commerce Streets.  

●   The purpose of the request is to  amend the  text of  existing Planned  Development  
     District No. 714 to create a new subdistrict within the existing PD to allow a reduction  
     in  mix of retail and personal service uses for a mixed-use project, live-work units as  
     new allowable use, and to reduce the minimum floor-to-floor dimension for ground  
    floors. The applicant requests this amendment because the existing required ground  
    floor  retail  space  has  been  difficult  to  lease.  Therefore,  the  applicant  wants  to  
    creatively fill this space  by proposing to reduce the retail and personal service use  
     percentage requirements of a mixed-use project from five to two percent and activate  
    the space by replacing the existing retail spaces with live-work units instead.  

●   The  applicant proposes to reduce the minimum  floor-to-floor  dimension  for ground  
    floors to divide existing space into 2 levels.

Traffic:

roadway system. Staff will continue review of engineering plans at permitting to comply  
with city standards.  
  
  
STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The new  ForwardDallas  2.0! Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the City Council in  
September 2024.  ForwardDallas 2.0 is the citywide Compressive Plan for future land use  
in the City of Dallas. Adopted by City Council in September 2024, the plan includes a  
future  land  use  map  and  guidance  for  a  future  vision  of  the  City  of  Dallas.  It  also  
establishes goals and guidelines for land use and other decisions by the City. According  
to the City of Dallas’s Development Code, the comprehensive plan serves merely as a  
guide for rezoning requests, but does not establish zoning boundaries nor does it restrict  
the City’s authority to regulate land use.   
  
ForwardDallas 2.0 is a guidance plan, it is not a zoning document. This Comprehensive  
Plan outlines several goals and policies which can serve as a framework for assisting in  
evaluating the applicant’s request.

Z245-118(LC)  

The request would comply with the following placetype(s) and primary/supporting land  
uses of the ForwardDallas 2.0 Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The area of request is situated within the Neighborhood Centers Land Use and the City  
Residential  Placetype. This placetype allows the following primary land uses: Multiplex,  
Apartments   and   Mixed-Use;   in   conjunction   with   secondary   land   uses   including:  
Agricultural,  Public  Open  Space,  Private  Open  Space,  Single  Family  Detached  &  
Attached,  Lodging, Commercial, Office, Civic/Public Institutional and Utility. The request  
would be specifically considered the Mixed-Use primary land use.  
   
The  City  Residential  neighborhoods  primarily  consist  of  high  and  midrise  multifamily  
development, complemented by townhomes and duplex housing. For City Residential  
areas surrounding Downtown Dallas, development is concentrated in compact blocks with  
quality access to transit and a high degree of connectivity to surrounding neighborhoods.  
Mixed-use buildings in urban areas, generally developed vertically (multiple uses in a  
single     building),      also    offer     retail    and     commercial        amenities       along      fixed  
transit/transportation nodes, hubs, and corridors.  
  
The area of request is an existing six story mixed-use project that includes 331 apartment  
units with 17,745 square feet of retail and personal service uses, but it is important to add  
a note that new development in this placetype should align with the established building  
form and character of the city residential development patterns. These new developments  
should be well-integrated within the natural landscape and consideration should be given  
a connectivity approach to preserve existing fabric of the area. The request is consistent  
with Forward Dallas 2.0 as it is an existing mixed-use project that offers the neighborhood  
variety in housing type and convenience of needed goods and services to residents in the  
immediate area and community.

The 360 Plan:  
  
Summary:  
The 360 Plan was adopted by the City Council in December 2017 as a guide to future  
actions  concerning  land  use  and  development  regulations,  transportation,  economic  
development and capital improvement expenditures in the area generally bounded by a  
two-and-a-half-mile radius centered on the intersection of Main Street and Akard Street.  
This  plan  outlines  three  transformative  strategies  suggested  by  City  Council  with  an  
overall goal that focuses on a complete and connected city center for future growth and  
development throughout the city.  
  
Staff finds the request does comply with the following transformative strategies and their  
respective  goals  of  the  360  Plan,  as  this  plans’  focus  is  housing  ranging  from  type,  
affordability, variety/diversity and placement.   
  
West Dallas Urban Structures and Guidelines Area Plan:  
  
Summary:  
The  objective  for  the  Urban  Structure  is  to  facilitate  the  organic  revitalization  and  
urbanization  of  a  portion  of  West  Dallas.  The  Urban  Structure  outlines  both  the  
conservation and revitalization of an established single-family neighborhood. Additionally,  
it describes incremental and organic change in urban form along with the potential for  
comprehensive  re-development  to  support  a  truly  livable,  sustainable,  attractive  and  
engaging community. The plan outlines urban guidelines on park and open space, street  
and public realm guidelines and architecture. It advocates an approach to implementation  
that allows for flexibility and adaptability over time as redevelopment unfolds.  
The area is divided into nine neighborhoods, and is identified for describing a unique  
character, vision, and combination of land uses for the Urban Structure.  
  
Vision:  
The development objectives for the area include:  
     1.   Preserve, enhance, conserve the La Bajada community in its entirety;  
     2.   Re-Create  Singleton Boulevard  and  Commerce  Street as handsome "parkway"  
         streets entering the inner city;

The Trinity River Corridor Comprehensive Land Use Plan:  
  
The Trinity River Corridor includes approximately 44,000 acres in size - about 20% of the  
land area in Dallas. The boundaries of the corridor span from Royal Lane in the north to  
I-20 in southern Dallas, and approximately 1.5 miles on either side of the Trinity River.  
  
Vision:   
The  2050  Vision  Statement  for  the  Trinity  River  Corridor  in  Dallas:  The  Trinity  River  
Corridor is a unified collection of diverse neighborhoods and business centers at the heart  
of a unified and thriving Dallas, connected by a ribbon of blue water and green spaces  
that  is  the  Trinity  River.  Additionally,  the  Trinity  River  Corridor  is  the  City's  model  for  
economic growth without physical, social or economic barriers, which attracts residents  
and visitors to live, learn, work, shop and play within a cosmopolitan urban core, and  
alongside the river's meandering environment. Five objectives for future development in  
the Trinity Corridor add detail to the 2050 Vision Statement. They provide guidance that  
shapes this plan's recommendations for each part of this very large corridor. The five  
objectives are:  
     •   Reconnect North and South Dallas  
     •   Establish the role of economic development along the Trinity River  
     •   Create a vibrant central city  
     •   Establish the Trinity River floodplain as the front yard of the City  
     •   Enhance the City's urban form to increase the appeal of urban life  
  
Summary:  
This  Comprehensive  Land  Use  Plan  is  an  important  tool  for  the  individuals  and  
organizations that make decisions affecting the Trinity River Corridor. Its broad vision  
describes the character this corridor should have in the future. It establishes the general  
principles that will direct preparation of detailed plans for smaller parts of this large area.

It provides guidance about the appropriate land uses and development patterns for the  
corridor that can be used by citizens, property owners and City officials as they review  
specific  development  proposals.  The  Trinity  River  Corridor  Comprehensive  Land  Use  
Plan is the 'blueprint' for this future. The plan's main sections are:  
  
     •   A Vision to Transform Dallas' Trinity River Corridor, which imagines the future of  
         this corridor and describes its key features;  
     •   Land Use and Urban Design Throughout the Trinity Corridor, which explains the  
         overall principles that should guide land use and urban design in all parts of the  
         Trinity Corridor;  
     •   Implementation  Strategies  Throughout  the  Trinity  Corridor,  which  explains  the  
         capital projects and other tools needed to carry out this plan;  
     •   Trinity Corridor District Plans, which provides more detailed direction about the  
         development patterns parts of the corridor;  
     •   Creating This Plan, which summarizes the process used to prepare this plan; and  
     •   Background  Documents,  which  lists  the  resource  reports  produced  during  the  
         planning process.

West Dallas Comprehensive Land Use Study :  
  
Staff  finds  the  request  does  comply  with  the  West  Dallas  Comprehensive  Land  Use  
Study.  
  
Fort Worth Avenue Land Use Plan, 2005:  
  
Summary:  
In March 2003, Dallas City Council directed the Development Services Department to  
conduct the Fort Worth Avenue Corridor Land Use and Urban Design Plan. A Steering  
Committee  led  the  effort  and  included  key  City  departments,  other  governmental  
agencies,  area  residents,  property  and  business  owners.  The  Fort  Worth  Avenue  
Development  Group  (FWADG)  helped  organize  broad-based  representation  of  area  
residential, business, property owner and citizen interests.  
  
The  study  analysis  examined  needs  associated  with  code  compliance,  economic  
development, infrastructure improvements, crime and public safety, transportation, land  
use, and zoning. The plan identifies opportunities to create a more walkable, mixed use  
urban development pattern.

The plan provides a 'vision' of the community's desires for re-development and lists the  
tools  needed  to  get  there.    Special  Purpose  District  (PD  714),  the  West  Commerce  
Street/Fort Worth Avenue Special Purpose District, was adopted in February 2005 using  
the study as its basis.  
  
Vision:  
To "…create a more balanced mix of neighborhood friendly development; improve and  
support the overall stability of existing single family residential neighborhoods that abut  
the   corridor;   incorporate   high   quality   development   and   redevelopment;   enhance  
pedestrian connections between neighborhoods across the corridor; respect the value of  
historic properties; and address infrastructure and transportation needs".

PD No. 714, Subdistrict 1A  
https://dallascityhall.com/departments/city-attorney/Articles/PDF/Article%20714.pdf  
  
The applicant proposes the creation of a new subdistrict within existing PD No. 714, using  
the code, conditions and development standards of the existing subdistrict(s) as the base  
for  the  new  subdistrict  with  slight  changes  to  the  retail  and  personal  service  uses  
percentage requirements of a mixed-use project, decreasing from five to two percent, live- 
work units as new allowable use, and a reduction to the minimum floor-to-floor dimension  
for ground floors.   
  
To the north of the property are  PD. No. 714; Subdistrict 1A, PD. No. 891, IR Industrial  
Research District & SUP No. 573 with retail, commercial and multifamily uses, as well as  
vacant  lots.  To  the  south  of  the  property  are  PD.  No.  714;  Subdistrict  1A  &  1D,  IR  
Industrial Research District with multifamily and retail uses. To the east are PD. No. 714;  
Subdistrict 1A w/ SUP No. 2383 with residential and mixed-uses and to the west of the  
property is PD. No. 714; Subdistrict 1B including residential, retail and commercial uses.  
With the immediate area being mostly a mix of residential and commercial retail uses and  
the subject site being in a location that is set to become a thriving hub of mixed-use, staff  
finds the applicant’s request for a PD amendment to be appropriate and compatible with  
the surrounding area.

             PD 714 was established by Ordinance No. 25898, passed by the Dallas City Council on February  
  23, 2005. (Ord. 25898)  
  
  
  SEC. 51P-714.102.                            PROPERTY LOCATION AND SIZE.  
  
             PD 714 is established on property located north and south of West Commerce Street and Fort  
  Worth Avenue from North Beckley Avenue to Westmoreland Road. The size of PD 714 is approximately  
  410.427 acres. (Ord. Nos. 25898; 26876; 27056; 28505; 31570; 32073)  
  
  
  SEC. 51P-714.103.                            CREATION OF SUBDISTRICTS.  
  
             (a)        This district is divided into the following subdistricts:  
  
                      (1)         Subdistrict 1. This subdistrict is for medium density mixed-use development that  
respects existing businesses but gives incentive for new mid-rise commercial and residential development.  
Development should support West Commerce Street as the gateway from downtown into  the area, and  
strengthen the Sylvan Avenue-Fort Worth Avenue intersection as a retail anchor. New development should  
support future light rail along the northern edge of the subdistrict. Preserving historic buildings through  
adaptive re-use is a priority. This subdistrict will be the most densely developed urban subdistrict due to its  
proximity to the Trinity River and downtown. The mix of uses should lean more to commercial, although  
residential development is essential to the success of the mixed uses. Buildings should front the street with  
broad sidewalks. Street trees should line the street edge. On-street parking should be parallel parking along  
West Commerce Street and Fort Worth Avenue. Off-street parking should be provided behind buildings or  
in parking structures and shared between adjacent lots. This subdistrict should have an overall urban feel,  
but still provide pedestrian amenities. Subdistricts 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D,  and  1E, 1F, and  1G have maximum  
building heights and maximum stories that reflect the rising topography and protect the downtown view.  
Buildings should have minimum or no setbacks, with commercial and retail uses at the ground level and  
office  and  residential  above.  Pedestrian  protections  from  traffic,  such  as  street  trees,  planters,  and  
crosswalks, are desired. Subdistricts 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1D,  and  1E, 1F, and 1G  are part of Subdistrict 1.  
Except as provided in this article, Subdistrict 1 regulations apply in Subdistricts 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, and  1E,  
1F, and 1G.

STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan Consistency Review:  
  
The new  ForwardDallas 2.0! Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the City Council in  
September 2024.  ForwardDallas 2.0 is the citywide Compressive Plan for future land use  
in the City of Dallas. Adopted by City Council in September 2024, the plan includes a  
future  land  use  map  and  guidance  for  a  future  vision  of  the  City  of  Dallas.  It  also  
establishes goals and guidelines for land use and other decisions by the City. According  
to the City of Dallas’s Development Code, the comprehensive plan serves merely as a  
guide for rezoning requests, but does not establish zoning boundaries nor does it restrict  
the City’s authority to regulate land use.  
  
ForwardDallas 2.0 is a guidance plan, it is not a zoning document. This Comprehensive  
Plan outlines several goals and policies which can serve as a framework for assisting in  
evaluating the applicant’s request.  
  
The request would comply with the following placetypes and primary/supporting land uses  
of the ForwardDallas 2.0 Comprehensive Plan:  
  

                                                            8-3

Z245-125(LC)  

The  area  of  request  is  situated  within  the  Neighborhood  Centers  Land  Use  and  the  
Community Residential Placetype. This placetype allows the following primary land uses:  
Single Family Detached & Attached; in conjunction with secondary land uses including:  
Agricultural, Public Open Space, Private Open Space, Multiplex, Apartments, Mixed-Use,  
Commercial, Office, Civic/Public Institutional and Utility.      
  
Placetypes  describe  the  long  term  vision  and  desired  building  and  preservation  
characteristics  for  different  places  within  the  city  including  neighborhoods,  mixed-use  
areas, employment and industry centers, and open spaces. They provide a high-level  
guide for the desired mix of land uses, design and the recommended intensity and scale  
of  the  different  uses.  Due  to  the  macro  scale  of  the  plan,  not  all  uses  or  design  
considerations  described  within  the  placetypes  may  be  suitable  for  every  individual  
property.  
  
The  primary  focus  of  the  Community  Residential  placetype  encompasses  the  largest  
percentage of land within Dallas and is primarily made up of single-family homes. Parks,  
schools, and places of worship are interspersed throughout, providing focal points for  
community activity. Sensitively integrated housing types, such as duplexes and smaller- 
scaled multiplexes, can be found in many of these areas. Local commercial and office  
uses, as well as neighborhood-scaled apartments, may also be found, generally along  
main  streets  and  at  intersections,  offering  convenient  access  to  goods  and  services,  
promoting a greater mix of uses, and supporting active, walkable environments..  
  
The area of request is an existing and established business, but it is important to add a  
note that new development in this placetype should align with the established building  
form and character of the community residential placetype development patterns. These  
new   developments   should   be   well-integrated   within   the   natural   landscape   and  
consideration should be given a connectivity approach to preserve existing fabric of the  
area.  The request is consistent with Forward Dallas 2.0 as it is a commercial business  
that  offers  neighborhood  stability  and  fosters  community  engagement  by  providing  a  
much needed service to the immediate area and community.

  Land Use Compatibility:  
    
  The area of request is currently developed with an existing building (car wash),  parking  
  lot and existing auto service center, on property zoned Planned Development District No.  
  366, Subarea 2 (approx. 1.02 acres in total size), located on the west line of Conner Drive,  
  south of Bruton Road.  
    
  PD No. 366, Subarea 2  establishes that a specific use permit is required for the auto  
  service center use under Subarea 2.  
  https://dallascityhall.com/departments/city-attorney/Articles/PDF/Article%20366.pdf  
    
  To the north of the property,  there is a car wash. Across Conner Drive to the east are  
  undeveloped properties zoned NO(A) with deed restrictions [Z834-107] and single family  
  uses zoned R-7.5(A). There are large undeveloped lots to the south of the property along  
  Conner, as well as vehicle display, sales, and service. All the existing vehicle display,  
  sales, and service uses are accessed from South Buckner Boulevard only. Northwest and  
  west of the subject property, there is a general merchandise or food store greater than  
  3,500 square feet mixed with some residential uses.   
    
  The subject property is located within Subarea 2 of Planned Development District No.  
  366, which allows a mix of commercial uses, similar in comparison to a CS Commercial  
  Service District. The previous case, Z223-116(MP) was recommended for denial as staff  
  found that the specific auto-oriented uses require approval of an SUP in the existing PD,  
  including  auto  service  center;  vehicle  display,  sales,  and  service;  and  car  wash.  
  Additionally, staff did not believe the request would be able to properly align with certain  
  goals  of  the  original  ForwardDallas  comprehensive  plan.  In  staff’s  understanding,  the  
  previous request would call for new automotive uses to be particularly well-sited relative  

                                                           8-5

to existing residential neighborhoods. Upon new review, staff finds the applicant’s request  
for a  vehicle display, sales, and service use to  be  appropriate and compatible with the  
surrounding  area  and  existing  residential  uses  by  adding  restrictions  to  the  hours  of  
operation and prohibiting outdoor speakers.  
  
The  general  provisions  for  a  Specific  Use  Permit  in  Section  51A-4.219  of  the  Dallas  
Development  Code  specifically  state:  (1)  The  SUP  provides  a  means  for  developing  
certain uses in a manner in which the specific use will be consistent with the character of  
the neighborhood; (2) Each SUP application must be evaluated as to its probable effect  
on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as  
the  findings indicate appropriate; (3) The city council shall not grant an SUP for a use  
except  upon  a  finding  that  the  use  will:  (A)  complement  or  be  compatible  with  the  
surrounding uses and community facilities; (B) contribute to, enhance, or promote the  
welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; (C) not be detrimental to the public  
health, safety, or general welfare; and (D) conform in all other respects to all applicable  
zoning regulations and standards. The regulations in this chapter have been established  
in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the health, safety,  
morals, and general welfare of the city.  
  
Landscaping:  
  
Landscaping will be provided in accordance with the landscaping requirements in Article  
X and PD. No. 366, as amended.  
  
Beyond the Article X requirements, the PD calls for the following additional requirements:  
         - Front yard strip landscaping with an average depth of 5 feet, minimum depth of  
         3 feet, and maximum depth of 25 feet is required at the front property line with  
         street trees. This is only triggered in the event of new construction or significant  
         additional paving area.  
         - On-site parking must be screened with:  
                   (A) a minimum three-foot-high solid fence, with an 18-inch wide  
                   planting bed located on its street side; or  
                   (B) shrubs with the potential to attain a minimum height of 30 inches within  
                   a three-year time period.  
                    
Based on the site plan, it is unlikely these provisions and others will be triggered.  
  
                                       

                                                          8-6

Z245-125(LC)  

Parking:  
  
Both uses of auto service center and vehicle display, sales, and service require 1 space  
per 500 square feet of floor area. The site plan depicts 6,700 square feet of building area,  
which would require 14 spaces. The plan provides 24 parking spaces.  
  
At permitting, the applicant would be required to comply with the standard parking ratios  
for the specified use(s), as well as any other uses permitted under the existing Planned  
Development District No. 366.  
  
Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to target intervention strategies more precisely in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is currently  in a “G” MVA area. There are both  the  “G”  and “H”  
MVA areas  immediately to the north and west of the subject property. To the east and  
south is only the “G” MVA area.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
●   The area of request is currently split zoned a CR Community Retail District and an IR  
     Industrial Research District, developed  with existing  building, driveway and parking  
     area (approx. 17,525 square feet in total size).  

●    Purpose   is   to   rezone   one   lot   and   one   part   of   another   lot   to   allow   office  
    showroom/warehouse uses on the site.  

●    Geographically located in Northwest Dallas, approx. 8 miles from downtown.  

●    Split zoning  exists on this site  due to the way the  lots were separated and zoned in  
    the past.  Therefore, the applicant is looking to zone everything under one to create  
     cohesiveness.  

●    Code  Compliance  stopped  by  existing  business  and  requested  that  the  business  
     change the use from Auto Service Center to Office/Showroom/Warehouse as this use  
     more accurately reflects the business.  

●   To accomplish this, the applicant is requesting general zoning change.  

●    Since the February 20, 2025, meeting there have been no changes to the request or  
    zoning case.  

    Zoning History:  

There have been zero zoning cases in the area in the last five years.

  The forwardDallas! Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the City Council in June 2006  
  and outlines several goals and policies which can serve as a framework for assisting in  
  evaluating the applicant’s request.  
  The request would comply with the following land use goals and policies of the  
  Comprehensive Plan:  
    
  LAND USE ELEMENT

    Land Use Compatibility:  
      
    The area of request is currently  split zoned  a CR Community Retail District and an IR  
    Industrial Research District, developed with existing building, driveway and parking area  
    (approx. 17,525 square feet in total size).  
      
    In every direction adjacent to the property, except the south, is the IR Industrial Research  
    zoning  district  with  a  combination  of  commercial  retail,  wholesale  distribution  and  
    warehouse  uses. With the immediate area being mostly composed of commercial retail,  
    staff finds the applicant’s requested zoning change to CS Commercial Service District to  
    be appropriate and compatible with the surrounding and immediate area as CS would be  
    less  intensive  in  terms  of  land  uses  allowed.  Additionally,  the  max  building  height  is  
    reduced significantly with CS, in comparison to the existing IR and CR zoning districts, as  
    well as building intensity. Although there are  some single-family  residential uses to the  
    south and east, staff believes  the request  would  fit in this area and within the  existing  
    fabric of the neighborhood.  Additionally, the business already exists and operating the  
    owner is looking to be compliant with code by operating under the appropriate use. This  
    compatibility is further reflected in the development standards comparison table below.

Landscaping:  
  
Landscaping must be provided in accordance with the landscaping requirements in  
Article X, as amended. As a part of Article X requirements, the applicant’s property will  
need to meet, including street buffer zone and residential buffer zone, as described  
below.  
  
Residential Buffer Zone (RBZ):   
Per SEC. 51A-10.125 residential buffer zone landscape area must be provided along  
that portion of the perimeter of a lot where residential adjacency exists. The residential  
buffer zone must have an average depth of 10 feet, a minimum depth of five feet, and a  
maximum depth of 30 feet. No portion of the residential buffer zone may exceed 10  
percent of the lot depth excluding paved surfaces at points of vehicular and pedestrian  
ingress or egress.   
         (B) The residential buffer zone must include a minimum of one plant group every  
         40  feet. Plant groups must include:   
              (i)      Where screening is required, one minimum three-inch caliper large or  
                       medium tree.   
              (ii) Where screening is not required:   
                  (aa) one large or medium tree and three small trees;   
                  (bb) one large or medium tree and three large evergreen shrubs;   
                  (cc) one large or medium tree, two small trees, and one large evergreen  

                                                        13-10

                  shrub; or   
                  (dd) one large or medium tree, one small tree, and two large evergreen  
                  shrubs.   
         (C) If the building official determines that the location of a local utility prohibits  
         planting large trees or medium trees, two small trees may be planted for each  
         large tree or medium tree.   
         (D) Large or medium trees must have a minimum caliper of two inches.  
  
Due to the residential adjacencies immediately to the west, southwest and south of the  
subject site, the applicant will be required to implement the residential buffer zone, as  
referenced above, that fits the subject site.  
  
Parking:  
  
Pursuant to the Dallas Development Code, the off-street parking requirement for the office  
showroom/warehouse  use under the requested CS Commercial Service District are as  
follows;   
  
     1.   Office: One space per 333 square feet of floor area  
     2.   Showroom/warehouse: One space per 1,000 square feet of floor area for the first  
         20,000 square feet of floor area. One space per 4,000 square feet of floor area in  
         excess of 20,000 square feet  

At permitting, the applicant would be required to comply with the standard parking ratios  
for  the  specified  use,  as  well  as  any  other  uses  permitted  under  the  proposed  CS  
Commercial Service District.  
  
  
Market Value Analysis :    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund.  Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to target intervention strategies more precisely in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is in an “H” MVA area. The site is surrounded by the “H” MVA area  
in all directions immediately adjacent to the site.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
●    The area of request is currently zoned PD No. 143 (PD 143) for a private school [The  
     Covenant Knights School] and is developed with seven (7)  buildings (approx. 136,240   
     sq. ft. of building coverage), an athletic field, and a detention pond.  

●    Geographically located in Far North Dallas.  

●    The athletic field, high school buildings, and several storage buildings are located on  
     the private school campus nearest IH-635 and Valley View Lane. The elementary and  
     middle  schools  are  located  just  north  of  these  facilities  within  zone  3  of  Planned  
     Development No. 143.  

●    No changes to the existing uses are proposed for the property. However, the existing  
     approved development conceptual plan does not allow the requested construction of  
     a  guard  house  within  the  front  yard  setback  at  the  entrance  or  allow  new  surface  
     parking to be located off of Valley View Lane as proposed.  

●    An  updated  traffic  management  plan  is  being  submitted  with  this  PD  amendment  
     application.  

●    On   September   9,   2020,   City   Council   approved   an   amendment   to   Planned  
     Development   No. 143 for  a private  school, subject to a site plan, landscape plan,  
     traffic management plan, and conditions.   
       
●    The purpose of the request is to allow a new guardhouse to be constructed within the  
     front setback at the entrance along Valley View Lane, add a new surface parking area  
     along   Valley   View   Lane,   and   a   revised   development,   landscape,   and   traffic  
     management plan, and conditions.  
           
●    On February 20, 2025, the City Plan Commission held this item under advisement to  
     March 6, 2025. Changes were made  to the request  after the docket was published  
     and distributed to the Commission.   
           
●    On  March  6,  2025,  the  City  Plan  Commission  held  this  item  under  advisement  to  
     March 20,2025. All changes made to the request have been included in this request.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The area of request currently  has seven (7)  buildings (approx.  136,240  square feet of  
building coverage),an athletic field  (Frank Miller Field)  and a detention  pond  zoned  PD  
143 for a private school designated Zone 3 or B on the development/concept plan on the  
northwest corner of  IH-635 (LBJ Fwy.) and Valley View Lane.   
  
To the north of the site is single family and a cemetery. To the south across LBJ Freeway  
is White Rock Creek with a pedestrian trail and a church.  To the east is multifamily and  
to the west is a park and recreational facility (Valley View Park) and south of the property  
are single family uses. To the east of the property is an existing church. Since the  private  
school  has been operating for a number of years and  is surrounded by residential uses  
and recreational, public uses to support the community school, staff finds the applicant’s  
request to be appropriate and compatible with the surrounding area.    
  
Staff supports the applicant’s request and finds the proposed rezoning to be appropriate  
for this area as it would continue to serve the existing neighborhood.  The applicant is not  
proposing  any  further expansion  of  buildings  beyond  what  is  allowed  per  the existing  
development plan or increasing the number of existing allowable classrooms to  ensure  
appropriate scale and compatibility with the surrounding area.  Staff is supportive of the  
proposed conditions, including the addition of a guard house within the front yard setback  
for safety at the entrance of the site at Valley View Lane as it will not disturb any existing  
landscaping or pervious surface. Also, allowing the bleachers for the athletic field to be  

                                                             9-5

Z234-271(LL)  
  

as shown on the concept plan will still require the bleachers to be setback 75’ from Valley  
View as required.   
  
The applicant’s request to remove the hours of operation for the classrooms will allow the  
school to determine the appropriate operations for the school facility while   the Traffic  
Management Plan will still determine the appropriate separation of dismissal times for the  
pre-K through sixth and seventh through twelfth grades for optimal traffic flow.  Finally,  
staff is supportive of the applicant’s request to remove the requirement in the PD for the  
right-turn deceleration lane at the proposed entrance. If a right-turn lane is determined to  
be required at the time of permitting, the building permit will be subject to that requirement  
as appropriate.  
  
Staff supports the request because it will allow the school to operate in a manner that will  
not be a detriment to the adjacent properties and the surrounding roadway system. Staff  
supports the zoning request, subject to an amended development plan/concept plan, and  
amended conditions. Staff considers the requested amendment to be compatible with the  
surrounding area because compliance with the proposed conditions, concept plan, and a  
Traffic Management Plan requiring periodic updates will ensure the operation continues  
to have optimal efficiency into the future.   
  
Landscaping:  
  
Landscaping  must  be  provided  in  accordance  with  Article  X  and  the  landscaping  
requirements in PD 143, as amended and the attached landscape plan.  
  
Parking:  
  
The requirement for off-street parking for the school is derived from three criteria: 1) the  
number of classrooms, 2) the type of institution that serves the students (e.g., elementary,  
middle or high school), and 3) the parking requirement established by the PD. Required  
parking for the site is 271 parking spaces. The requirement is met as there are currently,  
approximately 286 parking spaces for the school.  
  
The applicant is proposing an additional  approximately  68 parking spaces  in a surface  
parking lot near the corner of IH-635 and Valley View Lane for parents. Staff is supportive  
of the request as the applicant is mitigating any tree removal  or the new parking area,  
meeting the required number of street trees required, and exceeding the number of on- 
site trees required.  The site only has 17% lot coverage, far below the maximum 40% and  
has significant open space and landscaping to provide permeability. The applicant is also  
providing pervious pedestrian pathways through the parking lot to allow safe pedestrian  

                                                           9-6

movement through the parking areas to connect to the existing pedestrian pathway to the  
nearest building. Staff is supportive of the request.  
   
Market Value Analysis:   
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts.   The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to target intervention strategies more precisely in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is currently in a “D” MVA area. To the north, southwest, east, and  
west of the site is the “D” MVA area.  To the southeast of the of the site is the “F” MVA  
area.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The area of request is currently a medical clinic. The property abuts CR Community retail  
and P(A) Parking districts.   
  
The area of request is currently zoned an  CR Community Retail  District. The applicant  
proposes to convert the existing medical clinic into an alcoholic beverage establishment.  
The facility is proposed to operate seven days a week from 4:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. To  
accomplish this, the request of a specific use permit was submitted.   
  
The request is in alignment with existing uses within the corridor. The proposed use would  
not have a detrimental effect to the surrounding properties. There are current uses that  
do include amplified sound (outdoor speakers) in the area while this request does not.   
Another  important  consideration  with  the  applicant’s  request  is  the  initial  three  year  
period.  
  
The  general  provisions  for  a  Specific  Use  Permit  in  Section  51A-4.219  of  the  Dallas  
Development  Code  specifically  state:  (1)  The  SUP  provides  a  means  for  developing  
                                                              10-4

certain uses in a manner in which the specific use will be consistent with the character of  
the neighborhood; (2) Each SUP application must be evaluated as to its probable effect  
on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as  
the findings indicate appropriate; (3) The city council shall not grant an SUP for a  use  
except  upon  a  finding  that  the  use  will:  (A)  complement  or  be  compatible  with  the  
surrounding uses and community facilities; (B) contribute to, enhance, or promote the  
welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; (C) not be detrimental to the public  
health, safety, or general welfare; and (D) conform in all other respects to all applicable  
zoning regulations and standards. The regulations in this chapter have been established  
in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the health, safety,  
morals, and general welfare of the city.  
  
Landscaping:  
  
Landscaping must be provided in accordance with the landscaping requirements in Article  
X, as amended.  
  
Parking:  
  
The Dallas Development Code requires off-street parking to be provided with one space  
per  100  square  feet  per  Section  51A-4.209  Bar  and  Restaurant  Uses.  The  1,355  
proposed square feet for the use would require 14 spaces.  
  
Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund.  Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to more precisely target intervention strategies in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets.  The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I).  The area of request is currently in an “A” MVA cluster that extends to the north and  
west. South of the request area across Lovers Lane are “B” MVA clusters.

Traffic:  
  
The Transportation Development Services Division of the Transportation Department has  
reviewed the request and determined that it will not significantly impact the surrounding  
roadway system. Staff will continue review of engineering plans at permitting to comply  
with city standards.  
  
STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The forwardDallas! Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the City Council in June 2006  
and outlines several goals and policies which can serve as a framework for assisting in  
evaluating the applicant’s request.   
  
The request is an accessory use in nature and  does not standalone  support the goals  
and policies of the comprehensive plan;  therefore,  a goal was not selected to convey  
compliance or lack thereof.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The approximately 0.40-acre area of request is currently developed with an approximately  
2,000-square-foot  general  merchandise  or  food  store  (a  convenience  store).  A  fuel  
canopy  structure  is  situated  closer  to  the  corner  of  the  property at  the  intersection  of  
Holcomb Road and Lake June Road.  
  
The general merchandise of food store 3,500 square feet or less is permitted by right per  
Section 51A-4.122(b)(2)(J); however, the sale of alcoholic beverages requires a Specific  
Use Permit within a D-1 Liquor Control Overlay.  
  
The  general  provisions  for  a  Specific  Use  Permit  in  Section  51A-4.219  of  the  Dallas  
Development  Code  specifically  state:  (1)  The  SUP  provides  a  means  for  developing  
certain uses in a manner in which the specific use will be consistent with the character of  
the neighborhood; (2) Each SUP application must be evaluated as to its probable effect  
on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as  
the findings indicate appropriate; (3) The city council shall not grant an SUP for a use  
except  upon  a  finding  that  the  use  will:  (A)  complement  or  be  compatible  with  the  
surrounding uses and community facilities; (B) contribute to, enhance, or promote the  
welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; (C) not be detrimental to the public  
health, safety, or general welfare; and (D) conform in all other respects to all applicable  
zoning regulations and standards.  The regulations in this chapter have been established

convenience goods and gasoline, and has less than 10,000 square feet of retail floor  
space; the term does not include any business that has no retail floor space accessible  
to the public.  The purpose of Chapter 12B is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of  
the  citizens  of  the  city  of  Dallas  by  reducing  the  occurrence  of  crime,  preventing  the  
escalation of crime, and increasing the successful prosecution of crime that occurs in  
convenience  stores  in  the  city.  This  chapter  establishes  a  registration  program  for  
convenience stores and provides requirements relating to:   
  
     •   surveillance camera systems,                                •    security signs,   
     •   video recording and storage                                 •    height markers,   
         systems,                                                    •    store visibility,   
     •   alarm systems,                                              •    safety training programs, and   
     •   drop safes,                                                 •    trespass affidavits.   
           
A  separate  certificate  of  registration  to  comply  with  Chapter  12B  is  required  for  each  
physically  separate  convenience  store.   A  certificate of  registration  for a  convenience  
store expires one year after the date of issuance and must be renewed annually.   
  
No information on the status of the 12B compliance nor TABC licensing requirements at

Market Value Analysis:  
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  
understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to more precisely target intervention strategies in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is currently in an “H” MVA area.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
•    The  approximately  2.26-acre  area  of  request  is  a  portion  of  a  larger  property  of  
     approximately  3.22  acres. The  existing  property  is  split  between  an  approximately  
     0.96-acre   MF-2(A)   Multifamily   District   (west   of   the   area   of   request)   and   an  
     approximately  2.26-acre  CR  Community  Retail  District  (the  area  of  request).  The  
     request, if approved, would establish a consistent MF-2(A) Multifamily District across  
     the subject property.  
       
•    Because  this  is  a  general  zoning  change  request,  there  are  no  site  plans  or  
     development conditions associated with the request. If approved, development of the  
     property would only be permitted in accordance with the Dallas Development Code,  
     as amended, including all permitted uses within the MF-2(A) Multifamily District.  
       
•    The subject property is bordered to the west, north, and east by multifamily residential  
     uses zoned within a MF-2(A) Multifamily District. The northwest corner of John West  
     Road  and  La  Prada  Drive,  located  to  the  south  and  east  of  the  subject  site,  is  
     developed with a general merchandise (convenience) store and motor vehicle fueling  
     station (gas pumps).  
  
•    The area of request is positioned near the corporate City Limits; properties across  
     John West Road to the south of the area are located within the City of Mesquite, Texas.  
       
•    This item was held under advisement at the February 20 and March 6, 2025, City Plan  
     Commission meetings; no updates or changes have been proposed.   
       
Zoning History:  
  
There have been zero zoning cases in the area in the last five years.

STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The forwardDallas! Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the City Council in June 2006.  
The  forwardDallas!  Comprehensive Plan outlines several goals and policies which can  
serve as a framework for assisting in evaluating the applicant’s request.   
  
The request complies with the following land use goals and policies of the Comprehensive  
Plan:  
  
LAND USE ELEMENT  
  
GOAL 1.1            ALIGN  LAND  USE  STRATEGIES  WITH  ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  
                    PRIORITIES  
  
                    Policy 1.1.7  Ensure  appropriately  located  capacity  to  achieve  growth  
                                       targets.  
  
GOAL 1.2            PROMOTE DESIRED DEVELOPMENT  
  
                    Policy 1.2.2  Establish clear and objective standards for land use planning.  
  
GOAL 1.3            PROVIDE EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DALLAS RESIDENTS  
  
                    Policy 1.3.1  Create housing opportunities throughout Dallas.  
  
ECONOMIC ELEMENT  
  
GOAL 2.1            PROMOTE BALANCED GROWTH  
  
                    Policy 2.1.1  Ensure that zoning is flexible enough to respond to changing  
                                       economic conditions.

Area Plan(s):  
  
In  March  2013,  City  Council  adopted  the  2-Points  to  White  Rock  East Area  Plan,  a  
neighbor-driven plan conceived under the auspices of the Ferguson Road Initiative and  
the Truett Crime Watch. Residents felt that part of White Rock Hills in far east Dallas, was  
experiencing relative neglect and high crime. This and the changing demographics for  
this area which reflects greater cultural, ethnic, and age diversity, were the impetus for  
the plan.  Residents wanted to guide change in their tree-canopied neighborhoods where  
young families can grow and older citizens can age in place.  
  
The area of request is located within the Urban Neighborhood Building Block. Per the 2- 
Points  to  White  Rock  East  Area  Plan,  Urban  Neighborhoods  “…are  predominately  
residential but are distinguished from other neighborhoods by the wide variety of housing  
options they provide and easy access to public transit. Housing choices should include  
single-family  detached  dwellings,  townhomes  and  low-  to  midrise  condominiums  or  
apartments.” Emphasis is placed on respecting existing single-family neighborhoods and  
encouraging the renewal and repurposing of aging multifamily complexes.  
  
The  request  is  in  alignment  with  the  2-Points  to  White  Rock  East Area  Plan,  as  the  
permitted uses within the MF-2(A) Multifamily District are consistent with the vision of the  
Urban       Neighborhood           Building      Block.      Furthermore,         comparable         densities       and  
consideration for surrounding neighborhoods would be achieved through the base zoning  
and  development  requirements  within  the  MF-2(A)  Multifamily  District  and  Dallas  
Development Code.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The   approximately   2.26-acre   area   of   request   is   a   portion   of   a   larger   property  
approximately 3.22 acres in area. The existing property is split between an approximately  
0.96-acre MF-2(A) Multifamily District (west of the area of request) and an approximately  
2.26-acre CR Community Retail District (the area of request). The request, if approved,  
would establish a consistent MF-2(A) Multifamily District across the subject property.  
  
The subject property is bordered to the west, north, and east by multifamily residential  
uses zoned within a MF-2(A) Multifamily District. The property to the south and east of  
the subject site, located at the northeast corner of John West Road and La Prada Drive,  
is developed with a general merchandise (convenience) store and motor vehicle fueling  
station (gas pumps).  
  
The       following       considerations          are  
represented  in  Figure  1,  as  specified  
below.  The split zoning condition on the  
subject  property  (outlined  in  red)  does  
not   readily   support   development   on  
either  the  MF-2(A)  Multifamily  District  
area  or  CR  Community  Retail  District  
area. The northwest corner of John West  
Road and La Prada Drive is developed  
with    a    convenience        store     and     gas  
pumps   (labeled   “A”),   limiting   access  
from  La  Prada  Drive  (labeled  with  a  
purple  line)  to  the  approximately  2.26- 
acre CR Community Retail District area  
of request (labeled “B”). The remaining  
approximately            0.96-acre         MF-2(A)  
Multifamily District area  (labeled “C”)  is                              Figure  1. Subject Property Zoning Conditions  
consequently             wedged            between  
developed multifamily property to the north and west, and the 2.26-acre CR Community  
Retail District area of request. This results in an irregularly “flag-shaped” area that is not  
conducive to cohesive development patterns.  
  
A comparison of the MF-2(A) Multifamily District and CR Community Retail District zoning

Staff supports the request because the requested zoning of the property would allow for  
consistent  or  complimentary  land  uses  with  surrounding  properties,  including  but  not  
limited  to  multifamily  residential.  The  request  would  establish  a  consistent  MF-2(A)  
Multifamily   District   across   the   subject   property,   allowing   for   a   more   consistent  
development pattern than possible under the current split zoning conditions.   
  
Landscaping:  
  
Landscaping must  be provided in accordance with Article X of the Dallas Development  
Code, as amended.  
  
Parking:  
  
Parking will be provided in accordance with the applicable use standards of the Dallas  
Development  Code,  as  amended.  For  the  proposed  use  of  multifamily,  one  space  is  
required per bedroom.  
  
Market Value Analysis:  
  
Market   Value  Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  
understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to more precisely target intervention strategies in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is currently in an “I” MVA area.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
●   The area of request is currently undeveloped.  

●   The applicant proposes to develop retail and restaurant uses near Belt Line Road and  
    a mini-warehouse in the rear on the property.   

●   The majority of the property fronting along South Beltline Road is zoned a CR District  
    and allows retail  development.  There is  a strip of land on the northeast side of the  
    property that is zoned a  CS  District. The rear of the property is zoned  an  R-7.5(A)  
    District.   The   parcel   ranges   from   approximately   53   feet   wide   in   the   rear   to  
    approximately 94 feet wide in the front.   

●   The only districts that allow a mini-warehouse without an SUP are CS, industrial, and  
    central area districts. A mini-warehouse is allowed with an SUP in CR, RR, mixed use,  
    and multiple commercial districts. Residential districts do not permit a mini-warehouse  
    use.  

●   The  applicant’s  original  submission  was  for  a  planned  development  (PD)  district  
    served  to  eliminate  the  time  limit  typically  required  by  an  SUP  with  no  significant  
    deviations from base zoning proposed.   

●   Before the February 6, 2025 CPC meeting, the applicant revised the application to a  
    CS District, with deed restrictions volunteered to ensure compatibility with surrounding  
    residential districts.   

●   The proposal presented to CPC on February 6, 2025, did not restrict the locations of  
    the retail development or mini-warehouse; however, the applicant’s list of volunteered  
    deed  restrictions,  which  prohibits  many  uses  in  the  CS  District,  was  considered  
    acceptable.  City Plan Commission instructed staff to renotify the case for a planned  
    development district.  

●   Since the February 6, 2025 City Plan Commission meeting, the applicant has offered  
    an alternative consideration of an MU-1 Mixed Use District with a Specific Use Permit  
    with the conditions, including the time limit term of 20 years, as included in this case  
    report.  

Zoning History:  

One zoning case has been in the area within the last five years.  
  
     1.  Z234-270:  On  February  26,  2025,  the  City  Council  approved  the  renewal  of  
         Specific Use Permit No. 1883 for the sale of alcoholic beverages in conjunction

STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  
  
The forwardDallas! Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the City Council in June 2006.  
The  forwardDallas!  Comprehensive Plan outlines several goals and policies which can  
serve as a framework for assisting in evaluating the applicant’s request.   
  
The request complies with the following land use goals and policies of the Comprehensive  
Plan:  
  
ECONOMIC ELEMENT  
  
GOAL 2.1           PROMOTE BALANCED GROWTH  
  
                   Policy 2.1.1  Ensure that zoning is flexible enough to respond to changing  
                                      economic conditions.  
                     
                   Policy 2.1.3 Support efforts to grow retail and residential opportunities in  
                                      the Southern Sector.

Area Plan(s):  
  
In  April  2007,  City  Council  approved  the  West  Kleberg  Area  Plan  to  guide  future  
development in the area generally located south of Interstate 20 and bounded by Stark  
Road and the Dallas city limit to the east, Dallas County to the south, and Saint Augustine  
Road  and  Haymarket  Road  to  the  south.  The  goals  and  actions  of  the  area  plan  
complement  the  goals  and  policies  of  the  forwardDallas!  Comprehensive  Plan  in  
evaluating the applicant’s request.   
  
The request complies with the following land use goals of the West Kleberg Area Plan:   
  
LAND USE & ZONING   
  
GOAL 1             Protect the rural character of the community by encouraging commercial  
                  development along the commercial corridors.   
  
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   
  
GOAL 1             Economic  development  that  encourages  business  retention  and  attracts  
                  new “neighborhood serving” business uses to the community.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The  above  table  describes  the  zoning  and  land  uses  of  the  area  of  request  and  the  
surrounding land uses.   
  
The majority of the property fronting along South Beltline Road is zoned a CR District and  
allows retail development. There is a strip of land on the northeast side of the property  
that is zoned a CS District. The rear of the property is zoned an R-7.5(A)  District. The  
parcel ranges from approximately 53 feet wide in the rear to approximately 94 feet wide  
in the front.

Z234-277(SM)  

  
The only districts that allow a mini-warehouse without an SUP are CS, industrial, and  
central area districts. A mini-warehouse is allowed with an SUP in CR, RR, mixed use,  
and multiple commercial districts.  
  
The  general  provisions  for  a  Specific  Use  Permit  in  Section  51A-4.219  of  the  Dallas  
Development  Code  specifically  state:  (1)  The  SUP  provides  a  means  for  developing  
certain uses in a manner in which the specific use will be consistent with the character of  
the neighborhood; (2) Each SUP application must be evaluated as to its probable effect  
on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as  
the findings indicate appropriate; (3) The city council shall not grant an SUP for a use  
except  upon  a  finding  that  the  use  will:  (A)  complement  or  be  compatible  with  the  
surrounding uses and community facilities; (B) contribute to, enhance, or promote the  
welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; (C) not be detrimental to the public  
health, safety, or general welfare; and (D) conform in all other respects to all applicable  
zoning  regulations  and  standards.    The  request does  not  appear to  have an adverse  
impact on the surrounding zoning and land uses.  
  
The  applicant’s  original  submission  was  for  a  planned  development  (PD)  district  and  
included a one-story retail development in the front and a mini-warehouse in the rear.  
Since the time limit typically required by an SUP is not limited  in a PD request and no  
significant  deviations  from  base  zoning  were  proposed,  the  applicant  revised  their  
application  to  base  zoning  with  deed  restrictions.  The  proposal  did  not  restrict  the  
locations of the retail development  or mini-warehouse; however, the applicant’s list of  
volunteered  deed  restrictions  prohibited   many  uses  in  the  CS  District,  and  staff  
considered them acceptable.    
  
On February 6, 2025, CPC instructed staff to re-advertise  this case for a  PD instead.  
Because  staff  cannot  support  a  PD  with  the  sole  purpose  of  not  having  a  time  limit  
imposed,  staff  still  cannot  support  the  applicant’s  proposed  PD.  The  proposed  PD  
conditions offer no design standards, prohibit residential uses, and it do not support any  
more City goals that a straight-zoning with an SUP could achieve.   
  
Fortunately, the applicant has agreed to modify their previous request and proposes an  
MU-1 Mixed Use District with an SUP for a mini-warehouse for a twenty-year period. The  
proposed SUP reiterates the conditions proposed in the applicant’s alternate proposed  
PD conditions and allows the site to be re-evaluated in 20 years. Additionally, the MU-1  
District would still allow residential uses and has a limited number of nonresidential uses  
that are compatible with the surrounding uses. Therefore, staff supports the request for  

                                                       14-5

The following is a comparison chart of the development standards for the current R-7.5(A)  
Single  Family  and  CR  Community  Retail  District  and  the  proposed  expansion  of  CS

Market Value Analysis:    
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  

understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
Reinvestment  Fund  prepared  the  analysis  for  the  City  of  Dallas.  Public  officials  and  
private actors can use the MVA to target intervention strategies more precisely in weak  
markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets. The MVA identifies nine  
market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strengths or weaknesses.  
As illustrated in the attached MVA map, the colors range from purple, representing the  
strongest markets (A through C), to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request and the surrounding areas are in an “H” MVA area.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
  
•    The area of request is currently zoned primarily an R-7.5(A) Single Family District as  
     well as an IR Industrial Research District. The area of request is undeveloped.  

•    The area of request is bounded by Arrow Road, Bonnie View Road, and Southerland  
     Avenue .  

•    The applicant proposes to redevelop the property with single family housing.   

•    To accomplish this, they request a TH-3(A) Townhouse District.  

•    Additionally,  applicant  has  volunteered  deed  restrictions  pertaining  to  maximum  
     dwelling      units,     spacing       between        dwelling      units,    open      space,       homeowner’s  
     associations, and street frontages.  

Zoning History:  
  
There have been no zoning cases in the area in the last five years.

Traffic:  
  
The Transportation Development Services Division of the Transportation Department has  
reviewed the request and has provided the following comment:  
  
The proposed townhome district of this scale lacks development standards at permitting,  
which could lead to a development that maximizes dwelling unit counts over preserving  
neighborhood character and ensuring safety. The development code permits long, wide,  
and straight roads, long blocks, and front-loaded structures creating a series of continuous  
driveways, lacking front yards and clear sidewalks. The design would also compromise  
on-street parking, creating straight roads with wide pavement widths that encourage high- 
speed traffic and offer no pedestrian amenities.

Trinity River Corridor Land Use Plan:  
  
The Trinity River Corridor is a unified collection of diverse neighborhoods and business  
centers at the heart of a unified and thriving Dallas, connected by a ribbon of blue water  
and green spaces that is the Trinity River. Additionally, the Trinity River Corridor is the  
City's model for economic growth without physical, social or economic barriers, which  
attracts residents and visitors to live, learn, work, shop and play within a cosmopolitan  
urban core, and alongside the river's meandering environment. Five objectives for future  
development in the Trinity Corridor add detail to the 2050 Vision Statement. They provide  
guidance that shapes this plan's recommendations for each part of this very large corridor.   
  
The area of request is within the North Trinity Forest District. The plan designates the  
area  as  a  “Residential  Traditional”  module,  which  is  intended  to  have  single  family  
detached housing as the primary land use, making up about 65% of the land uses within  
such a module. The module also calls for about  10% of uses to be “Residential –  Multi- 
family 2”.   
  
The proposed use is for single family detached housing, which complies with the vision  
of the Trinity River Corridor Land Use Plan.

Land Use Compatibility:  
  
The area of request is currently  undeveloped. The site is generally surrounded by  R- 
7.5(A)  Single  Family  zoning  immediately  north,  south,  and  west,  with  predominantly  
single-family  houses.  Part  of  the  area  of  request  is  within  an  IR  Industrial  Research  
District, which includes a warehouse use outside of the area of request. Additionally, a  
large MF-2(A) Multifamily District exists to the east / south of the area of request and is  
undeveloped.  
  
The applicant wishes to develop the site with single family housing and has requested a  
TH-3(A) Townhouse District. The Townhouse Districts allow for smaller lot sizes for single  

                                                          15-4

family  homes  compared  to  the  Single  Family  Districts,  while  the  TH-3(A)  district,  in  
particular, allows for denser development than TH-1(A) or TH-2(A).   
  
As the predominant land uses in the area are detached single family houses and the  
proposed  deed restrictions will require the houses to be detached, staff finds that the  
proposal is compatible with the surrounding land uses. Additionally, the dedication of one  
acre of land for open space contributes to the area character by preserving a portion of  
the wooded, secluded nature of the area, rather than fully developing the site.  
  

Staff recognizes the concerns of Transportation regarding design standards for roadways.  
The total right-of-way for streets built in this development, per the Dallas Street  Design  
Manual, is 56 feet, with pavement widths of 36 feet. Parkways on each side must be ten  
feet. The Design Manual classifies TH-3(A) zoning districts alongside multifamily districts,  
whereas a  smaller Townhouse  District or a Single-Family  District would be able to use  
narrower streets in conjunction with an alley.   
  
Additionally,  base code would allow for construction of driveways that are adjacent to  
each  other,  creating  several  curb  cuts  throughout  the  development  which  affect  
pedestrian safety and visibility. Separation of driveways  by requiring additional spacing  
would improve the pedestrian realm and character of the development.  
  
Staff  finds  that  given  the  size  of  the  proposed  development,  a  planned  development  
district with a conceptual plan and standards for street widths, driveway spacing, sidewalk  
and sidewalk buffer widths, and pedestrian amenities would be better suited for this site.  
Such a development would allow the density envisioned while also promoting a safer  
environment.   
  
While the land use in and of itself is compatible with the surrounding area, the scale of  
the development and the accompanying base development standards raise concerns for  
staff,  as  outlined  above.  Therefore,  staff  finds  that  the  development  as  proposed  is  
incompatible with the surrounding uses.

Market Value Analysis:    
  
Market   Value   Analysis   (MVA),   is   a   tool   to   aid   residents   and   policy-makers   in  
understanding the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective,  
data-driven tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The  
analysis was prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials  
and private actors can use the MVA to  more precisely target intervention strategies in  
weak markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets.  The MVA identifies  
nine market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strength or weakness.  
As illustrated in the attached  MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is within an “H” MVA area.

SUMMARY:        Shifting focus from the quantity of  required off-street  parking spaces to  
                quality  and  location  of  off-street  parking  areas  will  align  the  Dallas  
                Development Code with adopted citywide transportation, environmental,  
                and land use policies by reducing priority of single-occupant vehicle trips  
                and  increasing  opportunity  for  housing,  business  activity,  and  multi- 
                modal  transportation  options.  A  Transportation  Demand  Management  
                Plan  will  apply  to  qualifying  development  projects.  Additional  design  
                standards will ensure new parking lots support a walkable environment.  

ZOAC RECOMMENDATION:                  Approval of ZOAC’s recommended amendments.  

STAFF RECOMMENDATION:                 Approval of staff’s recommended amendments.  

PRIOR CPC ACTION:                     On December 5, 2024, and January 16, February 13,  
                                      and March 4, 2025, the City Plan Commission moved  
                                      to hold this code amendment under advisement until  
                                      March 20, 2025.

1. Background  

    On March 3, 2025, the City Plan Commission (“CPC”) discussed the DCA190-002 Off-Street  
    Parking & Loading Code Amendment. The subject had previously been brought to CPC on  
    November 21, 2024, December 5, 2024, January 16, 2025, and February 13, 2025.   

    This code amendment was  initiated  on October 3, 2019. The Zoning Ordinance Advisory  
    Committee (“ZOAC”)  had  recommended  removing all minimum parking requirements for  
    land   uses     citywide,    updating     parking    design     requirements,      and    establishing     a  
    Transportation Demand Management Plan review requirement for qualifying developments.  
    This closely reflected staff’s recommendation to ZOAC.  

    On February 13, a motion was made to approve the ZOAC recommendation. The CPC then  
    took record votes on specific amendments to ZOAC’s recommendation on February 13 and  
    March 4. In total, 31 motions were made, and  CPC voted to hold the public hearing open  
    until March 4, 2025 to consider the complete amended proposal.  

2. CPC Amendments to ZOAC’s Recommendation  

Overall notes:  

     •   This CPC proposal is an amendment to the ZOAC recommendation of zero parking  
         minimums citywide. Unless a parking minimum is discussed below, it is still proposed to  
         be deleted.  

     •   §  4.100  lists  the  ½-mile  buffer  around  TOD  in  each  district  description,  and  directs  
         readers to § 4.200 for parking minimums by land use.  

     •   §  4.300  still  holds  the  general  parking  regulations,  and  has  new  provisions  in  §  
         4.301(a)(2)(A)  and  (B)  which  summarize  clearly  which  land  uses  have  parking  
         minimums and in which districts or geographies. A summary table of parking minimums  
         by land use has also been introduced into § 4.300 for convenience. Because our code  
         is  structured  so  that  §  4.200  authoritatively  states  the  parking  minimums,  this  table  
         “summarizes” those minimums in § 4.200. The reader is referred to § 4.200 for more  
         information on long or nuanced parking minimums.

           updated location caveat.  

     30.   Hampton. For microbrewery, micro-distillery, or winery, in Section 51A- 
           4.210(a)(4)(C)(ii), delete (aa) and (bb) and amend (cc) to say: “One space per 200  
           [100] square feet of floor area used for retail sales and seating. No parking is  
           required for any other floor area.” PASSES.  

           Implementation: Land use in 51A-4.210(b)(10) keeps updated minimums.

SEC. 51A-4.127.   URBAN CORRIDOR DISTRICTS.  

(a)   In general. A minimum of two land uses must be developed on a lot in an urban corridor district, with  
one use being residential use above street level. Density bonuses are awarded to lots that have parking  
structures. Parking requirements are reduced for lots that have linkages to transit and have a high level of  
pedestrian amenities. There are three types of urban corridor districts, differing principally in their density  

                                                          13  
                                                       16-24 

----------------------- Page 354-----------------------

and height allowances: UC-1, UC-2, and UC-3. The urban corridor district regulations apply to all frontages  
of the lot, except where otherwise specified.  

…  

(c)   UC districts.  

…  

    (5)   Off-street parking and loading. There are no minimum off-street parking amounts required for any  
    lot with some portion within 2,640 feet of a light rail transit station.   For any lot 2,640 feet or more from  
    a light rail transit station, cConsult the use regulations (Division 51A-4.200) for the specific off-street  
    parking requirements for each use. Consult the off-street parking and loading regulations (Divisions 51A- 
    4.300 et seq.) for information regarding off-street parking and loading generally.   

        (A)   Multifamily use parking requirements. One parking space is required per 500 square feet of  
        multifamily dwelling unit floor area on the lot, up to a maximum of two parking spaces per dwelling  
        unit.  

        (B)   Parking reductions. A lot located within 500 feet of a bus stop on a DART bus route, or a shuttle  
        bus route connecting to a DART light rail station, with a minimum headway, i.e. the scheduled time  
        interval between the arrival of successive same-route buses, trains, or other vehicles used for public  
        transportation at a passenger stop, of 10 minutes during peak hours and 30 minutes during non-peak  
        hours as these times are set by DART, shall be granted reductions of four percent of total parking  
        requirements  for  each  additional  pedestrian  amenity  type  provided  in  excess  of  the  minimum  
        amenities required [See Subsection (c)(8)(D) for pedestrian amenities rules], up to a maximum 20  
        percent reduction. If parking reduction is sought, bicycle parking must be provided as an amenity  
        type. The additional pedestrian amenities must be provided within the curb-to-building area and must  
        serve to enhance the pedestrian pathways from building entrances on the lot to transit stops. These  
        parking  reductions  do  not  apply  to  uses  that  already  have  parking  exemptions  based  on  delta  
        theory. [See Subsection 51A-4.704(b)(4)(A) for delta theory parking regulations.]  

        (C)   On-street parallel parking. On-street parallel parking spaces adjacent to the lot provided on  
        community      collectors    or  four-lane    arterials   count    toward     off-street  parking     requirements.  
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall abrogate the authority granted to the city's  
        traffic engineer by Chapter 28 of the Dallas City Code to regulate traffic, including parking, on public  
        streets.  

        (D)   Shared parking. Shared parking is required for all nonresidential uses on the lot. The utilization  
        rates in the following table provide the basis for calculation of parking spaces required with shared  
        parking. The adjusted standard off street parking requirement for the development is the largest of  
        the five “time-of-day” column sums.

(3 2)   Calculating required parking. In any district except a central area district, the off-street  parking  
requirements for each use are listed by use in Sections 51A-4.201 through 51A-4.217. For the purposes  
of determining required parking:  

    (A)   when a lot is used for a combination of uses, the off-street parking requirements are the sum  
    of the requirements for each use, and no off-street parking space for one use is included in the  
    calculation of off-street parking requirements for any other use, except as otherwise provided in this  
    division or in Division 51A-4.320;  

    (B)   site area, as defined in Section 51A-2.102, does not include that area occupied by off-street  
    parking, landscaped areas, and open space not used for storage or sales;   

    (C)   for purposes of determining required off-street parking, floor area does not include the area of  
    a building used exclusively to provide bicycle parking spaces.  

    (D)      fractional  spaces  are  counted  to  the  nearest  whole  number,  with  one-half  counted  as  an  
    additional space;  

 (4)   Location of parking on lot.  

    (A)   Except as specifically permitted in this article, all off-street parking must be provided on the lot  
    occupied by the main use or in a parking P(A) district in accordance with Section 51A-4.302.  

    (B)   Off-street parking is not permitted in a visibility triangle as defined in Section 51A-4.602.  

    (C)   Except for mechanized parking approved under Division 51A-4.340, in single family, duplex,  
    townhouse, and CH districts, off-street parking must be provided at or below ground level.  

    (D)    The board of adjustment may not authorize the placement of special parking, as defined in  
    Division 51A-4.320, in a residential district.  

    (E)   In nonresidential districts, any off-street parking may extend to the front property line.  

    (F)   Off-street parking provisions for residential districts.  

        (i)    In residential districts, any off-street parking for nonresidential uses must comply with the  
        minimum front yard requirements of Section 51A-4.401.  

        (ii)   In residential districts, except an MF-3(A) or MF-4(A) district, required off-street parking for  
        residential uses must be located behind a required front building line.  

        (iii)   In an MF-1(A), MF-1(SAH), MF-2(A), or MF-2(SAH) district, no required or excess parking  
        may be placed in the required front yard.  

        (iv)   In an MF-3(A) or MF-4(A) district, any off-street parking for residential uses may extend to  
        the front property line.  

        (v)   Except for mechanized parking approved under Division 51A-4.340, in single family, duplex,  
        townhouse, and CH districts, off-street parking must be provided at or below ground level.  

(5)   Design of parking.  

    (A)   Parking lots and structures shall be designed to prioritize pedestrian safety, convenience, and  
    connection to the existing public pedestrian network and pedestrian generators, including transit  
    stops and nearby residential properties and neighborhoods.  

    (B)   Driveway entrances.  

                                                     44

----------------------- Page 385-----------------------

            (i)   Every effort must be made to minimize the number and width of driveway entrances along  
            block faces, including sharing drives between developments and using improved alleyways, to  
            prioritize pedestrian, bicycle, and transit user safety.   

            (ii)   For single-family, duplex, and multifamily uses with a maximum of four dwelling units on one  
            lot, a maximum of one curb cut with a maximum width of 12 feet is allowed, and  curb cuts for  
            shared driveways are limited to a maximum width of 20 feet.   

        (C)   Pedestrian pathways in surface parking lots.  

            (i)      A  parking  lot  with  50  parking  spaces  or  more  must  provide  at  least  one  unobstructed  
            pedestrian pathway at least four feet in width through the parking lot that connects the primary  
            entrance to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the parking lot.  

            (ii)   When crossing a drive aisle, the pathway must be a contrasting color, material, or texture,  
            and raised to the level of the sidewalk.   

        (D)   Tree protection.   All trees within four feet of a parking space or drive aisle must be protected  
        from  contact  with  vehicles  through  the  use  of  concrete  curbs,  wheel  stops,  or  other  permanent  
        barriers.  

        (E)   Water from parking areas shall not drain onto or across the surface of a public sidewalk.  

    (6)   Waiver and relief from parking location and design regulations.  

        (A)   The director may grant an administrative waiver to deviate from Subsections (3) and (4)  if the  
        regulations cannot be met due to:  

            (i)   the presence of street easements;  

            (ii)      interference  with  service  provided  by  a  public  utility  or  state  regulated  entity  for  the  
            transmission of power, fuel, water, or communication services; or  

            (iii)   an increase in danger to pedestrians, cyclists, or motorists resulting from strict adherence  
            to the regulations.  

        (B)   The  board  may grant  a special exception to the provisions in subsections (3) and (4) if strict  
        compliance is impractical due to site constraints that would result in a substantial hardship, provided  
        that the hardship is not self-created and is not only financial..  

        (C)   In determining whether to grant a deviation to Subparagraphs (3) or  (4), the director or  board  
        shall consider whether the resulting development is consistent with the purpose of the development  
        code and with the comprehensive plan.  

(b) and (c)   Reserved.  

    (3)   When a lot is used for a combination of uses, the off-street parking requirements are the sum of the  
    requirements for each use, and no off-street parking space for one use is included in the calculation of  
    off-street parking requirements for any other use, except as otherwise provided in this division or in  
    Division 51A-4.320.  

    (4)   For purposes of determining required off-street parking, site area, as defined in Section 51A-2.102,  
    does not include that area occupied by off-street parking, landscaped areas, and open space not used  
    for storage or sales.

SEC. 51A-4.311.   SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.  

(a)   Special exception: parking demand.  

    (1)   The board may grant a special exception to authorize a reduction in the number of off-street  
    parking spaces required under this article if the board finds, after a public hearing, that the parking  
    demand generated by the use does not warrant the number of off-street parking spaces required, and  
    the special exception would not create a traffic hazard or increase traffic congestion on adjacent or  
    nearby streets. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the maximum reduction authorized by  
    this section is 25 percent or one space, whichever is greater, minus the number of parking spaces  
    currently not provided due to delta credits, as defined in Section 51A-4.704(b)(4)(A).  For the  
    commercial amusement (inside) use and the industrial (inside) use, the maximum reduction authorized  
    by this section is 75 percent or one space, whichever is greater, minus the number of parking spaces  
    currently not provided due to delta credits, as defined in Section 51A-4.704(b)(4)(A). For the office  
    use, the maximum reduction is 35 percent or one space, whichever is greater, minus the number of

----------------------- Page 391-----------------------

    parking spaces currently not provided due to delta credits, as defined in Section 51A- 
    4.704(b)(4)(A).  Applicants may seek a special exception to parking requirements under this section  
    and an administrative parking reduction under Section 51A-4.313.  The greater reduction will apply,  
    but the reductions may not be combined.   

    (2)   In determining whether to grant a special exception under Paragraph (1), the board shall consider  
    the following factors:  

        (A)   The extent to which the parking spaces provided will be remote, shared, or packed parking.  

        (B)   The parking demand and trip generation characteristics of all uses for which the special  
        exception is requested.  

        (C)   Whether or not the subject property or any property in the general area is part of a modified  
        delta overlay district.  

        (D)   The current and probable future capacities of adjacent and nearby streets based on the city’s  
        thoroughfare plan.  

        (E)   The availability of public transit and the likelihood of its use.  

        (F)   The feasibility of parking mitigation measures and the likelihood of their effectiveness.  

    (3)   In granting a special exception under Paragraph (1), the board shall specify the use or uses to  
    which the special exception applies.  A special exception granted by the board for a particular use  
    automatically and immediately terminates if and when that use is changed or discontinued.  

    (4)   In granting a special exception under Paragraph (1), the board may:  

       (A)   establish a termination date for the special exception or otherwise provide for the  
       reassessment of conditions after a specified period of time;  

       (B)   impose restrictions on access to or from the subject property; or  

       (C)   impose any other reasonable condition that would have the effect of improving traffic safety or  
       lessening congestion on the streets.  

    (5)   The board shall not grant a special exception under Paragraph (1) to reduce the number of off- 
    street parking spaces required in an ordinance granting or amending a specific use permit.  

    (6)   The board shall not grant a special exception under Paragraph (1) to reduce the number of off- 
    street parking spaces expressly required in the text or development plan of an ordinance establishing  
    or amending regulations governing a specific planned development district. This prohibition does not  
    apply when:  

       (A)   the ordinance does not expressly specify a minimum number of spaces, but instead simply  
       makes reference to the existing off-street parking regulations in Chapter 51 or this chapter; or  

       (B)   the regulations governing that specific district expressly authorize the board to grant the  
       special exception.  

    (7)   The board shall not grant a special exception under Paragraph (1) to reduce the number of off- 
    street parking spaces required for a commercial amusement (inside) used as a dance hall.   

(b)   Special exception: tree preservation.  The board may grant a special exception to authorize a  
reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required under this article if the board finds, after a  

                                                          51

must be protected from vehicular traffic through the use of concrete curbs, wheel stops, or other  
permanent barriers.  The maximum reduction authorized by this subsection is 10 percent or one space,  
whichever is greater, minus the number of parking spaces currently not provided due to already existing  
nonconforming rights.   

SEC. 51A-4.312.   TREE PRESERVATION PARKING REDUCTION.  

The number of  required off-street parking spaces  required under  this article  is reduced by one for each  
protected tree (as defined in Article X) retained that would otherwise have to be removed. The preserved  
tree  must  be  protected  from  vehicular  traffic  through  the  use  of  concrete  curbs,  wheel  stops,  or  other  
permanent barriers. The maximum reduction authorized by this section is  10 five  percent or one space,  
whichever is greater, minus the number of parking spaces currently not provided due to already existing  
nonconforming rights. (Ord. 22053)  

SEC. 51A-4.313.   ADMINISTRATIVE PARKING REDUCTION.  

(a)   The director may grant a  maximum  reduction  of 50% of  in  the number of off-street parking  spaces  
required under this article for business and commercial uses and industrial specific uses if the director finds  
that the parking demand generated by the use does not warrant the number of off-street parking spaces  
required, and the reduction would not create a traffic hazard or increase traffic congestion on adjacent or  
nearby streets.  
  
Applicants  may  seek  a  special  exception  to  parking  requirements  under  Section 51A-4.311 and  an  
administrative parking reduction under this section. The greater reduction will apply, but the reductions may  
not be combined.  
 The maximum reduction authorized by this section for specific uses is:  
  

  Use                                                           Maximum Administrative Reduction

SEC. 51A-4.322.   PURPOSE.  

This division provides alternatives to the standard parking and loading regulations in  Division 51A-4.300.  
Packed parking provides alternative dimensional requirements for parking spaces to allow maximal parking  
on a lot when an attendant is used to park vehicles. Remote parking and remote loading allows an exception  
to the requirement that all off-street parking and loading be provided on the lot occupied by the main use.  
Shared parking  and shared loading  allows  an exception to the requirement that no off-street parking  or  
loading space for one use be included in the calculation of the parking required for any other use.

(a)   Definitions. In this section:  

       DELTA THEORY means “delta theory” as defined in Section 51A-4.704 of this chapter.  

(b)   General provisions.  

       (1)   The city council may establish a modified delta overlay district in those areas where it  
      determines that a continued application of the delta theory is not justified because:  

                                                                 61

          (A)   there is no longer a need to encourage redevelopment and adaptive reuse of existing  
          structures; or  

          (B)   a continued application of the delta theory will create traffic congestion and public safety  
          problems and would not be in the public interest.  

      (2)   In a modified delta overlay district, the city council may limit the number or percentage of  
      nonconforming parking or loading spaces that may be carried forward by a use under the delta  
      theory. An ordinance establishing a modified delta overlay district in which nonconforming parking or  
      loading spaces are limited by number rather than by percentage must specify the method by which  
      the nonconforming spaces are to be allocated among property owners.  

      (3)   An ordinance establishing a modified delta overlay district may not increase the number of  
      nonconforming parking or loading spaces that may be carried forward under the delta theory when a  
      use is converted or expanded.  

      (4)   An ordinance establishing a modified delta overlay district must provide that when a use located  
      in the district is converted to a new use having lesser parking or loading requirements, the rights to  
      any portion of the nonconforming parking or loading not needed to meet the new requirements are  
      lost.  

      (5)   An ordinance establishing a modified delta overlay district may restrict or eliminate the  
      availability of the off-street parking special exception described in Section 51A-4.301(i).  

      (6)   An ordinance establishing a modified delta overlay district may allow the remote parking  
      distances contained in the special parking regulations (Division 51A-4.320) to be increased and  
      allow special parking to account for more than 50 percent of the off-street parking required for any  
      use. (Ord. Nos. 19786; 22471)

SEC. 51A-4.801.   PURPOSE.  

    The general objectives of this division are to promote and protect the health, safety, and general welfare  
    of  the  public  through  the  establishment  of  an  administrative  review  procedure  for  certain  proposed  
    development considered likely to significantly impact surrounding land uses and infrastructure needs  
    and demands. Development impact review should occur before the developer has completed a full set  
    of working drawings for submission as part of an application for a building permit. As part of the review  
    procedure, the developer may be required to submit  a  site plan indicating  building siting and layout,  
    buffering, landscaping, usable open space, access, lighting, loading, and other specific data. Site plan  
    review is not intended to mandate aesthetics of design, nor is it intended to alter basic development  
    standards such as floor area ratio, density requirements, height, setbacks, and coverage. (Ord. 19455)

         Road, south of Bonnie view Road. The request was approved on August 4, 2022,  
         but has not been recorded.  

STAFF  RECOMMENDATION  Section  51A-8.503  states  that  “lots  must  conform  in  
width, depth and area to the pattern already  established  in the adjacent areas, having  
due  regard  to  the  character  of  the  area,  its  particular  suitability for  development,  and  
taking  into  consideration  the  natural  topography  of  the  ground,  drainage,  wastewater  
facilities, and the proposed layout of the streets.”  

The  lot  is  being  created  from  a  tract  of  land;  therefore,  it  does  not  qualify  for  a  
residential replat and can be approved on the consent agenda.  

    •    The  properties  to  the  north,  east, south,  and  west of the  present  request  have  
         areas  ranging  in  size from  21,009  square  feet  to  283,225  square feet  and  are  
         zoned R-7.5(A) Single Family District. (Refer to the existing area analysis map) .  
           
The  request  lies  in  an  R-7.5(A)  Single  Family  District  which  has  a  minimum  lot  area  
requirement  of  7,500  square  feet.  The  request  is  to  create  one  0.505-acre  lot,  one  
0.575-acre lot, and one 0.920-acre lot from a 2.0-acre tract of land.  

Staff concludes that there is not an established lot pattern in the adjacent areas and the  
request  complies  with  the  requirements  of  Section  51A-8.503  and  R-7.5(A)  Single  
Family   District;   therefore,   staff   recommends   approval   of   the   request   subject   to  
compliance with the following conditions:

CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT: 3                                    SIZE OF REQUEST: 20.033-acres       

APPLICANT/OWNER: BCG W. Ledbetter Texas, LLC  

REQUEST: An application  to  replat a 20.033-acre tract of land containing all of Lots 8  
through 11 in City  Block 8033 to create one lot on property located on Ledbetter Drive,  
at the terminus of Dan Morton Drive.  

SUBDIVISION HISTORY:   

1.       S223-200  was  a  request  northeast  of the present request  to  create  one 25.54- 
         acre lot from a tract of land in City  Block 8032  on property located on  Ledbetter  
         Drive, east of Dan Morton Drive. The request was approved on July 20, 2023, but  
         has not been recorded.  

2.       S212-161  was a request  northeast of the  present  request  to create one 8.681- 
         acre lot and one 24.96-acre lot from a 33.64-acre tract of land in City Block 8032  
         on  property  located  on  West  Ledbetter  Drive,  west  of  Duncanville  Road.  The  
         request was approved on April 21, 2022, and was withdrawn on May 16, 2022.  

PROPERTY  OWNER  NOTIFICATION:  On  March  3,  2025,  45  notices  were  sent  to  
property owners within 200 feet of the proposed plat boundary.  

STAFF  RECOMMENDATION:  Section  51A-8.503  states  that  “lots  must  conform  in  
width, depth and area to the pattern already  established  in the adjacent areas, having  
due  regard  to  the  character  of  the  area,  its  particular  suitability for  development,  and  
taking  into  consideration  the  natural  topography  of  the  ground,  drainage,  wastewater  
facilities, and the proposed layout of the streets.”  

The request lies in  dual zoning district, TH-3(A)  Townhouse  District  and  IR Industrial/  
Research  District. TH-3(A) Townhouse  District  has  a minimum lot area  requirement of  
2,000   square  feet  for  single  family  structures   and  6,000  square  feet  for  duplex  
structures and  IR Industrial/ Research District has no minimum lot area requirement.   

The request is to create one 20.033-acre lot.  

Staff  finds  that  there  is  a  variation  in  lot  pattern  in  the  adjacent  areas  (Refer  to  the  
existing area analysis map);  and the request is in compliance with Section 51A-8.503  
and    also    with    the   requirements       of   the   TH-3(A)      Townhouse        District   and    IR  
Industrial/Research        District;    therefore,     staff   recommends         approval      subject     to  
compliance with the following conditions:

REQUEST:  An  application  to  replat  a  1.33-acre  (57,852.87-square  foot)  tract  of  land  
containing all of Lots  1 and 2 in City Block 8/8186 to create one lot on property  and to

feet along Valley Creek Drive on property located on Valley Creek Drive, north of Spring  
Valley Road.  

SUBDIVISION HISTORY:   

1.       S201-540 was a request south of the present request to  replat a 2.446-acre tract  
         of land containing all of Lots 3 and 4 in City Block L/7424 to create 3 Lots ranging  
         in  size  from  28,302  square  feet  to  41,386  square  feet  on  property  located  on  
         Spring  Valley  Road  at  Valley  Creek  Drive,  northwest  corner.  The  request  was  
         withdrawn on December 17, 2020.  

PROPERTY  OWNER  NOTIFICATION:  On  March  3,  2025,  17  notices  were  sent  to  
property owners within 200 feet of the proposed plat boundary.  

BUILDING LINE REDUCTION:  The  Commission may approve  a  reduction or  removal  
of the platted building lines with a minimum front, side, or rear yard setback greater than  
required by zoning regulation only:  

     1)  Upon  the affirmative  vote of  at  least  three-fourths  of  the  commission  members  
         present; and  

    2)   If the Commission finds that relocation or removal of the platted  building line will  
         not:  

           (i)   “Require a minimum front, side, or rear yard setback less than required  by  
                   zoning regulation.”  

            •    The existing  platted building line along the west  line of Valley Creek  Drive  
                 is  40  feet.  Minimum  required  front  yard  setback  is  30  feet  per  R-10(A)  
                 Single Family District.  

           (ii)   “Be contrary to the public interest;”  

            •    17  notices were sent to property owners within 200 feet of  the proposed  
                 plat.   

           (iii)  “Adversely affect neighboring properties; and”  

City Plan Commission Date: 03/20/2025                26(a)                                           S245-115  
  

----------------------- Page 491-----------------------

           •      The  reduction  of  a  portion  of  an  existing  40-foot  platted  building  line  by  
                  4.38 feet for the distance of 16.20 feet along Valley Creek Drive will bring  
                  the  existing  structure  in  compliance  to  R-10(A)  Single  Family  District  
                  regulation and City of Dallas development code.  

            (IV) “adversely affect the plan for the orderly development of the subdivision.”  

            •     The  reduction  of  the  40-foot  platted  building  line  along  the  west  line  of  
                  Valley Creek Drive will not impact the adjoining properties.   

STAFF  RECOMMENDATION  ON  BUILDING  LINE  REDUCTION:  The  request  is  to  
reduce a portion of an existing 40-foot building line by 4.38 feet for the distance of 16.20  
feet   along   Valley   Creek   Drive.   Staff   finds   that   the           request   complies   with   the  
requirements  of  Section  51A-8.505  of  the  Dallas  Development  Code;  therefore,  staff  
recommends approval of the reduction of the 40-foot platted building line along the west  
line of Valley Creek Drive.  

STAFF  RECOMMENDATION  ON  REPLAT:  Section  51A-8.503  states  that  “lots  must  
conform  in  width,  depth  and  area  to  the  pattern  already  established  in  the  adjacent  
areas,  having  due  regard  to  the  character  of  the  area,  its  particular  suitability  for  
development,  and  taking  into  consideration  the  natural  topography  of  the  ground,  
drainage, wastewater facilities, and the proposed layout of the streets.”  

     •   The  properties  to  the  north,  east, south,  and  west of the  present  request  have  
         areas  ranging  in  size  from  18,850  square  feet  to  65,164  square  feet  and  are  
         zoned  R-10(A)  Single  Family  District  and  R-1/2ac(A)  Single  Family  District.  
         (Refer to the existing area analysis map) .  
           
The  request  lies  in  an  R-10(A)  Single  Family  District  which  has  a  minimum  lot  area  
requirement  of  10,000  square  feet.  The  request  is  to  create  1.33-acre  (57,852.87- 
square foot) lot.  

Staff concludes that there is a variation in lot pattern in the adjacent areas of the request  
and  the  request  complies  with  the  requirements  of  Section  51A-8.503  and  R-10(A)  
Single  Family  District;  therefore,  staff  recommends  approval  of the  request  subject  to  
compliance with the following conditions:   

General Conditions:  
  
1.       The final plat must conform to all  requirements of the Dallas Development Code,  
         Texas  Local  Government  Code,  Texas  Land  Surveying  Practices  Act  and  the

APPLICANT: The Potters House of Dallas, Inc.   
REPRESENTATIVE: Claudio Segovia, P.E.   
   
REQUEST   
   
Amend the designation of Grady Niblo Road from a standard six-lane divided principal  
arterial roadway in 107 feet of right-of-way (S-6-D) to a minimum four-lane divided minor  
arterial roadway in 80 feet of right-of-way (M-4-D(A)), and (2) the designated alignment  
of the unbuilt portion of the roadway.   
        
BACKGROUND   
   
The City of Dallas Department of Transportation and Public Works has received a  
request from The Potters House of Dallas, Inc. to amend the City of Dallas  
Thoroughfare Plan to: (1) change the designation of Grady Niblo Road between  
Mountain Creek Parkway and Merrifield Road from a standard six-lane divided principal  
arterial roadway in 107-feet of right-of-way (S-6-D) to a minimum four-lane divided minor  
arterial roadway in 80-foot right-of-way (M-4-D(A)), and (2) adjust the designated  
alignment of the unbuilt portion of the roadway.   
   
Only a portion of the roadway within the limits of the requested amendment has been  
constructed, and currently exists as a four-lane divided roadway that terminates in a   
dead end. It is accessible from the intersection with Mountain Creek Parkway and  
provides access to warehouses on the north side. The requested changes to the  
roadway designation and alignment are driven by the planned expansion of the Capella  
Park residential development to the north, which will add an anticipated 325 new  
residential lots. The requested changes to the Thoroughfare Plan aim to address  
community concerns about the potential for high vehicle speeds and truck traffic on  
Grady Niblo Road once the unbuilt section is connected in the future.   
   
The applicant is requesting that the remaining unbuilt portion of Grady Niblo Road be  
built as a four-lane divided roadway in 80-feet of right-of-way (M-4-D(A)). Furthermore,  
the applicant is requesting to shift the Thoroughfare Plan alignment southward to create  
a buffer between the Capella Park neighborhood and the roadway, allowing additional  
space for contiguous residential development to the north of the future thoroughfare.  
The extended roadway is proposed to be constructed with the buildout of the future  

                                                         27-1

phases of Capella Park, which will be directly accessible from the future extension. It is  
also anticipated that roundabouts would be incorporated into the design of the roadway  
to promote traffic calming and discourage use of the roadway by large interstate trucks.  
The roadway classification in the Thoroughfare Plan is proposed to change from  
principal arterial to a minor arterial to reflect the reduced number of lanes and desire to  
discourage interstate truck traffic along the roadway.   

A  traffic  impact  assessment  was  submitted  by  the  applicant  that  indicates  that  future  
development can be accommodated with a four-lane divided roadway.   

PRIOR ACTION/REVIEW  

On February 6, 2025, City Plan Commission Thoroughfare Committee acted on this item  
and followed staff’s recommendation to approve the application.

PROPOSED COUNCIL AGENDA: April 23, 2025   

APPLICANT: Potters House of Dallas, Inc   
REPRESENTATIVE: Claudio Sergovia, PE  

REQUEST:  Amendment  to  the  City  of  Dallas  Thoroughfare  Plan  to  change  (1)  the  
designation of Grady Niblo Road between Mountain Creek Parkway and Merrifield Road  
from a standard six-lane divided principal arterial roadway in 107 feet of right-of-way (S6- 
D) to a minimum four-lane divided minor arterial roadway in 80 feet of right-of-way (M4- 
D(A), and (2) the designated alignment of the unbuilt portion of the roadway.

----------------------- Page 503-----------------------

BACKGROUND:  

•  Only a portion of the roadway within the limits of the requested amendment has been 
   constructed and currently exists as a four-lane divided roadway that terminates in a 
   dead end. 

                                          27-3 

----------------------- Page 504-----------------------

• 
    The requested changes to the roadway designation and alignment are driven by the  
    planned expansion of Capella Park to the north, which will add 325 new residential  
    lots. These changes aim to address community concerns about the potential for high  
    vehicle  speeds  and  truck  traffic  on  Grady  Niblo  Road  once  the  unbuilt  section  is  
    connected in the future.   

                                               27-4 

----------------------- Page 505-----------------------

•   
   
      The requested shift of the Thoroughfare Plan alignment southward will create a buffer  
       between the Capella Park neighborhood and the roadway, allowing additional space  
       for contiguous residential development to the north of the future thoroughfare.

      It is also anticipated that roundabouts would be incorporated into the design of the  
      roadway  to  promote  traffic  calming  and  discourage  use  of  the  roadway  by  large  
      interstate trucks   
   

                                                                                                                                                      
   
•     Grady   Niblo   Road,   between   Mountain   Creek   Parkway   and   Merrifield   Road,   is  
      designated  as  a  Mixed-Use  Street  by  the  City  of  Dallas  Complete  Streets  Design  
      Manual.    
         
•     Grady  Niblo  Road,  between  Mountain  Creek  Parkway  and  Merrifield  Road,  was  
      included in the 2011 City of Dallas Bike Plan. However, due to uncertainty surrounding  
      future development patterns, no segment of this corridor is currently proposed in the  
      2025 Bike Plan. That said, this area, along with other underdeveloped areas of the city,  
      will be recommended for further study to assess potential bike connectivity. Additionally,  
      the updated bike plan proposes a process for amending the plan, which would allow  
      recommendations for bike facilities to be added in the future as conditions evolve.   
   
•     On February 6, 2025, City Plan Commission Thoroughfare Committee acted on this  
      item and followed staff recommendation.   
         
•     17 property owners are in the notification area.

    BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
      
   On September 5, 2019, the City Plan Commission (CPC) recommended a city-initiated  
    review  of  the  zoning  for  an  area  generally  located  along  Hampton  Road  between  
    Burlington   Boulevard   and   Brandon   Street   and   along   Clarendon   Drive   between  
    Marlborough Avenue and the alley west of Hampton Road.  
      
   On January 19, 2023, the CPC expanded the boundaries of the previous area of request  
    to  include  the  area  generally  located  along  both  sides  of  Hampton  Road  between  
    Wentworth Street to the north and Burlington Boulevard to the south.   
      
   Between November 2020 and October 2022, the Planning and Development Department  
    (PDD), formerly Planning and Urban Design Department (PUD) engaged the community  
    in developing the West Oak Cliff Area Plan (WOCAP), which provided the  long-range  
    vision  for  land  use,  urban  design,  transportation,  infrastructure,  open  space,  and  
    community concerns in the West Oak Cliff area and identified several focus areas and  
    corridors for which a review of the zoning is recommended, including the Hampton Road  
    and West Clarendon Drive commercial corridors.  
      
   On  October  26,  2022,  WOCAP  was  unanimously  adopted  by  the  City  Council  and  
    became the impetus for prioritizing the rezoning of this authorized hearing area.   
      
   On  April  25,  2024,  an  initial  community  meeting  was  convened,  by  the  Planning  and  
     Development Department (PDD) and Councilmember Chad West, to kick off four of the  
    five  authorized  hearings  within  the  WOCAP  area,  including  Hampton  –  Clarendon  
    Corridors,  to  gather  in  put  from  property  owners  and  extended  community  regarding  
    zoning   ideas   that   would   best            implement   WOCAP’s   recommendations.   Spanish  
    Translation services were provided during this meeting.  
      
   Between March 16, 2024, and July 10, 2024 staff met with several stakeholders including  
    other  City  departments,  neighborhood  association  leaders,  Automotive  Association  
    Group,  and  business  owners,  to  discuss  potential  zoning  ideas  and  public  realm  
    enhancements as part of processing this authorized hearing while implementing the area  
    plan.   
               
   On July 10, 2024, the Planning and Development Department (PDD) hosted  a second  
    community meeting to introduce the zoning concepts for the two corridors, during which  
    staff introduced the Form Based District zoning standards and discussed the differences  
    between  the  City  of  Dallas’  form-based  zoning  code  (Article  XIII)  and  the  standard  
     Euclidean Zoning District (Chapter 51A Dallas Development Code). Spanish Translation  
    services were provided during this meeting.

   Between  July  10,  2024,  and  September  24,  2024,  Planning  and  Development  (PDD)  
    collaborated  extensively  with  the  Transportation  Department  and  Public  Works  to  
    evaluate alternative design scenarios aimed at improving the roadway configuration and  
    public  realm  enhancements.  These  scenarios  included  street  realignments,  revised  
    parking configurations, the integration of bike lanes, and the reactivation of alleys to align  
    with   the   objectives   of   the   form-based   district.   Concurrently,   staff   engaged   with  
    neighborhood association leaders and local business owners to develop and refine key  
    elements of the initial draft proposal. During these stakeholder discussions, feedback was  
    received emphasizing  the importance of limiting shopfront overlays  on  key roadway  to  
    intersections  to  discourage  townhouse  developments  on  corners,  thereby  preserving  
    those locations for retail-oriented design and uses.   
               
   On September 24, 2024,  Planning and Development Department (PDD)  hosted a third  
    community meeting, with English and Spanish translation, to present the proposed zoning  
    changes and public realm enhancements. During the meeting, attendees raised concerns  
    about several issues, including the allowance of car washes in the commercial corridors,  
    the need to  regulate  building heights, the introduction of multi-family housing along the  
    corridor, and the risk of displacement resulting from the rezoning— a recurring concern  
    throughout these discussions.  
               
   On  October  12th ,  2024,  PDD  staff  met  with  the  East  Hampton  Hills  Neighborhood  

    Association to present the proposed zoning and gather additional feedback. During this  
    meeting,  there  were  questions  from  the  residents  regarding  the  risk  of  displacement,  
    transportation plans along  West  Clarendon Drive, and potential transportation impacts  
    should the zoning be adopted.   
               
   On December 11 and 12, 2024,  PDD staff  hosted two (2) virtual meetings  (4th  and 5th  

    meeting) to reintroduce the proposed zoning framework and collect additional stakeholder  
    feedback,  with  a  specific  emphasis  on  engaging  property  owners.  These  targeted  
    outreach sessions were undertaken following staff’s observation of minimal participation  
    from  property  owners  in  previous  public  meetings.  The  December  11  meeting  was  
    conducted in English, while the December 12 meeting was held exclusively in Spanish to  
    ensure accessibility for Spanish-speaking stakeholders.  
               
   On December 17th , 2024, the Planning and Development Department  hosted the  sixth  

    community  meeting,  with  English  and  Spanish  translation,  to  gather  any  additional  
    feedback   regarding   the   previously             proposed   zoning   changes   and   public   realm  
    enhancements.  During the meeting, attendees expressed interest in exploring a height  
    overlay as a tool to discourage large-scale development  in the corridor  and provide  an  
    additional public review process so that developers would be forced to engage with the  

                                                           28-3

    The authorized hearing area consists of a mix of commercial, institutional, and residential  
     uses as well as undeveloped land. It is primarily surrounded by single-family uses.   
       
    The intent of the proposed zoning is to implement WOCAP’s recommendation of creating  
     a mixed-use district that is ideal for small scale businesses that are compatible with the  
     surrounding neighborhoods and support the implementation of traffic calming measures  
     to make the district more pedestrian friendly.

Zoning History:  
  
There have been no zoning cases in the authorized hearing area in the last five years.  
However, the Dallas City Council recently approved Z189-240, the Jimtown Authorized  
Hearing,  which  directly  borders  this  corridor.  Additionally,  last  year,  the  City  Council  
approved  Z178-142,  the  Downtown  Elmwood  Authorized  Hearing.  Both  cases  were  
authorized hearings within the West Oak Cliff Area Plan (WOCAP) boundary.  
  
Thoroughfares/Streets:  
The only roadway within the authorized hearing area in the thoroughfare plan is Hampton  
Road and Clarendon Drive.

STAFF ANALYSIS:  
  
Comprehensive Plan:  

ForwardDallas  2.0  Comprehensive  Land  Use  Plan,  adopted  by  the  City  Council  on  
September 25, 2024, is a long-range future land use vision that guides how and where  
the city should focus growth over the coming decades and describes how to achieve that  
vision.  The plan is rooted in five (5) overarching themes that serve as the foundation for  
the plan’s goals, objectives, and action steps.  This zoning  proposal complies with the  
following themes, goals, and objectives for implementation:  
  
Theme: Housing Choice and Access   
  
          Theme Goal:  Equitably increase attainable housing options throughout the city,  
          particularly  near  job  centers  and  transit-oriented  locations,  to  meet  the  diverse  
          housing needs of all people in Dallas.  
           
                   Objective.  Provide  a  Mix  of  Housing  Types  and  Affordabilities  to  Meet  
                   Diverse Needs.  
                     
                   Objective. Align Land Use Policy & Process with Housing Strategies, Plans  
                   and Programs  
                     
                                                          28-5

                   Objective. Protect and Preserve Neighborhoods  
  
Theme: Economic Development   
  
          Theme  Goal:  Promote  equitable  development  of  Dallas’  diverse  communities  
          across  the  city,  through  the  revitalization  of  neighborhood  centers,  commercial  
          corridors, employment centers, and transit areas.   
                     
                   Objective.        Implement          “Transformative           Placemaking”           Strategies       to  
                   Revitalize Commercial Corridors, Transit Nodes, and Employment Centers.

                   Business Development  
           
Theme: Community + Urban Design  
  
          Theme  Goal:  Adopt  and  implement  context-sensitive  design  and  development  
          guidance to help shape Dallas’ streets, sidewalks, buildings, and open  spaces,  
          ensuring functional, safe, sustainable, and vibrant spaces that not only reflect but  
          also enhance Dallas’ distinct places and diverse communities.   
  
                   Objective. Integrate Urban Design Standards and Guidance into the   
                   Development Review Process and Future Planning Efforts.  
  
                   Objective. Promote Quality Design Principles to Foster More Inclusive and  
                   Equitable Neighborhoods and Spaces Throughout Dallas.  
  
  
Placetype: Neighborhood Mixed Use  
  
ForwardDallas 2.0 establishes Placetypes to articulate the long-term vision and desired  
building  and  preservation  characteristics  for  different  areas  within  the  city,  including  
neighborhoods,  mixed-use  districts,  employment  centers,  and  open  spaces.  These  
placetypes  serve  as  a  high-level  framework  guiding  land  use,  urban  design,  and  the  
appropriate intensity and scale of development.  
  
The  Hampton  –  Clarendon  Corridor  Authorized  Hearing  (Z189-349)  falls  within  the  
Neighborhood  Mixed-Use  placetype,  which  is  intended  to  serve  as  a  focal  point  of  
commercial  and  social  activity  for  surrounding  residential  areas.  These  areas  are  
designed to accommodate local-serving retail, services, dining options, and a mix of low-  
and  medium-density  residential  uses.  Typically  located  at  key  intersections  or  along  
corridors,        Neighborhood            Mixed-Use           areas       support        small-scale         commercial  

                                                           28-6

development—such  as  shopping  centers  and  corner  stores—that  provide  convenient  
access to daily necessities for residents.  
  
The  proposed   WMU-3   form-based  district   aligns   with   this   vision  by   establishing  
predictable   development   standards   that   encourage   a   pedestrian-friendly,   context- 
sensitive  built  environment.  By  promoting  a  mix  of  uses  and  ensuring  that  new  
development   is   compatibly   scaled   with   adjacent   neighborhoods,   the   form-based  
approach  supports  ForwardDallas  2.0’s  goals  of  fostering  vibrant, walkable,  and  well- 
integrated mixed-use areas. Additionally, the flexibility inherent in form-based regulations  
allows  for  vertical  and  horizontal  mixed-use development,  ensuring  that  future  growth  
along the Hampton-Clarendon Corridor remains consistent with the comprehensive plan’s  
long-term objectives.  
  
Area Plan:  

  
The West Oak Cliff Area Plan (WOCAP)  

The West Oak Cliff Area Plan was unanimously adopted by the City Council on October  
26,  2022.  It  provides  a  long-range  vision  for  land  use,  urban  design,  transportation,  
mobility,  infrastructure,  open  space,  and  community  concerns  around  gentrification,  
displacement, and revitalization for several neighborhoods in west Oak Cliff, including the  
Hampton – Clarendon Corridor. WOCAP designates Hampton - Clarendon as a strategic  
opportunity area for economic growth and stresses the need for the area plan to guide its  
transformation into a vibrant walkable mixed-use district.  Staff’s recommendation for a  
WMU-3  district  is  consistent  with  WOCAP’s  goals,  objectives,  and  recommendations,  
especially the ones marked with an asterisk (*) below:  

WOCAP Goals  
     •   Create  walkable  neighborhood  centers  that  provide  a  variety  of  work,  cultural,  
         shopping, and living opportunities*  
     •   Encourage businesses that are compatible with surrounding neighborhoods*  
     •   Preserve historic buildings by encouraging renovation and reuse*  
     •   Protect existing single-family neighborhoods*  
     •   Improve transportation through better street design*  
     •   Retain current residents and attract new residents by encouraging new affordable  
         housing choices*  

WOCAP Objectives  
   I.    Land Use and Development  
         a.   Preserve and protect existing single-family neighborhoods. *  
         b.   Create walkable, neighborhood-scale, mixed-use centers. *  
         c.   Preserve  historic  buildings  and  character  through  neighborhood-sensitive  
              design. *

   II.     Transportation and Infrastructure  

           a.   Prioritize new sidewalk construction and sidewalk repair to improve  
               accessibility. *  
           b.   Utilize urban design improvements, within the public right-of-way, to enhance  
               placemaking and safety. *  
           c.   Construct new multimodal improvements and bike lanes throughout West  
               Oak Cliff. *  
           d.   Evaluate traffic calming through street design enhancements. *  
                  
                  
 WOCAP Recommendations  

 •    Amend  existing  CR,  MU-1,  CS,   RR,  and  P(A)  zoning  to  allow  for  mixed-use  
      development. New zoning should consider a form-based district with walkable urban  
      form  such  as  activated  facades,  wide  sidewalks,  and  appropriate  setbacks  and  
      proximity slopes to adjacent single-family uses. *  

 •    Development should be limited to the existing height limit of 54 feet. *  

 •    Permit residential uses, which should include small multifamily developments (12 units  
      or smaller) and townhomes. *  

 •    Ensure  future  land  uses  provide  pedestrian-oriented  design  through  public  realm  
      design  and  building  placement,  utilizing  design  standards  to  enhance  pedestrian  
      mobility  by  minimizing  curb  cuts,  parking  locations,  and  hazardous  vehicular- 
      pedestrian conflict points. *  

 •    In   alignment   with   citywide   parking   code   reform,   consider   reducing   parking  
      requirements   for   new   structures,   increasing   reductions   for   legacy   commercial  
      buildings, and allowing shared parking agreements and adjacent on-street parking to  
      facilitate redevelopment. Additionally, commercial uses along Clarendon should be  
      allowed to count on-street parking toward requirements to support the adaptive reuse  
      of historic buildings. *

 The area  of request comprises two  commercial streets  (Hampton Road and Clarendon  
 Drive) primarily surrounded by properties zoned R-7.5(A) Single-Family District and TH- 
 3(A) Townhouse-3(A) District. The corridor exhibits a diverse mix of land uses, including  
 retail  establishments,  restaurants,  professional  offices,  personal  service  providers,  
 institutional  uses  (such  as  churches  and  schools),  single-family  homes,  duplexes,  
 triplexes, auto-service facilities, a daycare center, and vacant land. To the north, the area  
 adjoins single-family residences and  places of worship including  the Iglesia Adventista  
 del  Septimo  Día  Dallas  Spanish  Church.  The  southern  boundary  of  the  corridor  is  
 contiguous with institutional uses, including the Disciple City Church, as well as single- 
 family  residential  properties.  Eastward,  the  area  is  predominantly  bordered  by  single- 
 family residences, combined with institutional uses like the Dallas Indian United Methodist  
 Church. The western edge of the corridor is adjacent to single-family homes, duplexes,  
 and institutional uses such as  Lida Hooe Elementary School. Approximately 0.44 miles  
 south of the southern boundary of the authorized hearing area lies the Hampton DART

Overview of Form Districts  
  
Form-Based Code (FBC) is a method of zoning where the codes and regulations focus  
on addressing the relationship between building facades and the public realm, form and  
mass of buildings relative to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks.  
Unlike the Euclidean zoning that primarily regulates allowable use and level of activity,  
form-based  zoning   code  focuses  on  the  compatibility  of  the  buildings  with  their  
surroundings, while letting the mix of actual activities in them be more eclectic.  Under  
form-based zoning, the desired form of buildings is typically more urban in style, and is  
located at the front of the site, closer to the street. This, coupled with enhanced standards  
for transparency, building articulation, and pedestrian amenities, are intended to ensure  
an active streetscape.   
  
The Form-based code  requires buildings to fill a percentage of the width of the lot with  
the building façade to create a streetscape that supports pedestrian activity and screens  
parking. Benefits include additional buildable area on the site, increased height, density,  
and floor area; and reduced parking requirements that encourage the use of multi-modal  
transportation.  Dallas’  form-based  code   is  contained  in  Article  XIII  of  the  City’s  
development code, which focus primarily on the quality, form, and relationship between  
streetscapes and building facades to create pedestrian friendly environments.  
  
Justification for a WMU-Walkable Mixed-Use District  
  

                                                       28-10

Z189-349(JP)  

Staff’s recommendation is for a Walkable Urban Mixed-Use District 3 (WMU-3), which is  
the lowest intensity development district among the six WMU district available in Article  
XIII. WMU districts are intended to create walkable urban form districts with variety of  
uses in a pedestrian friendly environment. There is no minimum size for a WMU district.  
Article XIII states that WMU districts are intended for locations where a sufficient critical  
mass of dense, walkable urban mixed-use development already exists or is planned. This  
critical mass is present when:  
  
             1.  The surrounding area consists of at least 40 acres of existing or definitely  
                  planned WMU or Walkable Urban Residential (WR)  District, high density  
                  multifamily  zoning,  multiple  use  zoning,  or  planned  development  zoning  
                  with equivalent characteristics.  

             2.  The surrounding area consists of at least 25 acres proposed by and is part  
                  of  and  adopted  area  plan  pursuant  to  forwardDallas!  for  WMU  or  WR  
                  zoning,  high  density  multifamily  zoning,  multiple  use  zoning,  or  planned  
                  development zoning with equivalent characteristics; or  

             3.  The applicant demonstrates that the surrounding area is at least 25 acres  
                  and is or will be a mix of dense residential, commercial, and other uses that  
                  will  achieve  the  intent  of  Article  XIII  for  increased  walkability,  reduced  
                  vehicular trip generation, and reduced parking demand.  

Staff finds the area of request to be appropriate for a WMU-3 district as it is surrounded  
by more than 35 acres of a dense residential district that contain a mix of uses such as  
commercial,  institutional,  and  open  spaces.  The  area  of  request  has  a  City  Council  
adopted area plan (WOCAP) that recommends a walkable urban mixed-use district. The  
area plan specifically calls for implementation a form district in the commercial  corridors  
to ensure increased walkability and reduced parking demand. Although it may seem like  
the area of request is primarily surrounded by single-family residences, there are a variety  
of  non-residential  uses  and  missing-middle  housing  that  exist  within  the  surrounding  
neighborhoods.   
  

Land Use Comparison  

Form-based zoning in Article XIII regulates land uses through a variety of development  
types that allow different use categories. It focuses primarily on the form of the building  
rather than its intended use. Rather than identify specific uses that are allowed in a given  
zoning district, form-based code specifies the development types that are allowed in that  
district. For instance, the following are the development types allowed in a WMU-3 district:  

                   Mixed-Use Shopfront  

                   Single-Story Shopfront  

                   General Commercial

                      Apartments (ground floor retail/office)  

                      Townhouse

                      Civic Building  

                      Open Space  
  
It should be noted that while single-family living is allowed in a WMU-3 district, a single- 
family house is not a permitted development type. The following is a comparison table  
showing differences in the permitted uses between the existing CR-Community Retail  
District, CS Commercial Services, RR Regional Retail, and MU-1 Mixed Use –  1 District,  
and staff’s recommended WMU-3 district. Blank cells indicate a comparable land use is  
not specified for that district.

Beyond  the  regulation  of  land  uses  through  development  types  in  Article  XIII,  each  
development type includes more traditional development standards (setbacks,  density,  
height,  etc.)  in  addition  to  enhanced  development  standards  that  contribute  to  a  
pedestrian friendly environment (street frontage, parking setbacks, transparency, etc.).

Parking              
Under staff’s recommendation for a WMU-3 district, any new development, and some  
changes of use, in the authorized hearing area would need to comply with the parking  
requirements of Article XIII. The parking requirements for different use categories are  
shown on the table below. In terms of alternative transportation, the closest DART bus  
route is route 101, which has seven (7) bus stops in both directions located on S Hampton  
Road. There is also another DART bus route, 226, with three bus stops in both directions  
on Clarendon Drive. Also, as part of WOCAP implementation and this rezoning effort, the  
Transportation Department has worked with PDD to redesign Clarendon Drive, within the  
authorized  hearing  area,  into  a  complete  street  with  dedicated  bike  lanes  and  wider  
sidewalks to make the  corridor  pedestrian and bike friendly. More detailed information  
related to parking is included in the ‘Staff Recommendation’ section of this report.

Height   
WOCAP  recommends  the  implementation  of  a  mixed-use  form  district  designed  to  
promote a walkable urban environment. This proposed district maintains alignment with  
the current Community Retail (CR) zoning, which permits a maximum building height of  
54 feet and four stories. Specifically, the recommended WMU-3 (Walkable Mixed-Use-3)  
district restricts building height to 50 feet and limits structures to three-and-a-half (3½)  
stories. To mitigate the impact of new development on adjacent single-family residences,  
development standards will incorporate protective measures, including adherence to a  
3:1   Residential  Proximity  Slope  (RPS).  This  RPS  establishes  a  regulatory  plane  
projecting upward and outward from the adjacent R-7.5(A) single-family zoning district,  
ensuring  that  any  portion  of  a  structure  exceeding  26  feet  in  height  cannot  encroach  
above  this  plane.  As  such,  most  of  Clarendon  Drive  will  be  unable  to  achieve  the  
maximum height allowed by the zoning due to limited lot depths. Similarly, several lots  
along Hampton Road, south of its intersection with Clarendon Drive, will also be unable  
to achieve the maximum height allowed by zoning. The physical makeup of these lots  
serves as natural guardrails ensuring that new development remains appropriate in scale  
and density.   
  
  
Shopfront Overlay (-SH)  
Shopfront (-SH) overlays are intended to create pedestrian shopping streets through the  
designation of street frontages with development types that support active uses. It can be  
applied  over  any  WMU  district  and  is  intended  to  accommodate  a  limited  set  of  
development types. (See Section 51A-13.304(a)(1), “Development Types by District.”)   
Where a shopfront overlay designation is applied, the standards for a mixed use or single- 
story  shopfront  development  type  apply  to  at  least  the  first  30  feet  of  the  building  
measured inward from the street-facing facade. Any street designated with a -SH overlay  
becomes a primary street. The boundaries of a shopfront overlay do not have to follow  
lot lines or match parcel boundaries.   
  
Market Value Analysis:  
Market Value Analysis (MVA), is a tool to aid residents and policymakers in understanding  
the elements of their local residential real estate markets. It is an objective, data-driven  
tool built on local administrative data and validated with local experts. The analysis was  
prepared for the City of Dallas by The Reinvestment Fund. Public officials and private  
actors can use the MVA to target intervention strategies more precisely in weak housing  
markets and support sustainable growth in stronger markets.  The MVA identifies nine  
market types (A through I) on a spectrum of residential market strengths or weaknesses.  
As illustrated in the attached  MVA map, the colors range from purple representing the  
strongest markets (A through C) to orange, representing the weakest markets (G through  
I). The area of request is mostly nonresidential, so most of it does not fall into any of the  
MVA clusters except small portions in the northern (E) and eastern tips (E). However, the  
residential blocks to the Southwest portion of the authorized hearing area have a slightly  
weaker housing market (MVA category H) than the rest of the surrounding areas (MVA  
category E). In general, the housing market within and around the Hampton – Clarendon  
Commercial corridor is in the midrange in terms of housing market strength.

STAFF RECOMMENDATION  
  
The Hampton –  Clarendon Corridor faces many challenges, not all of which are related  
to zoning. These challenges were the key factors for the development of the West Oak  
Cliff Area Plan (WOCAP) and the initiation of this authorized hearing. While the Hampton  
Road  commercial  corridor  is  home  to  numerous  successful  businesses,  the  area  is  
plagued  with  aging  infrastructure  and  a  lack  of  cohesive  urban  form.  From  a  zoning  
perspective, existing land uses with wide curb cuts and large parking lots, which are not  
well maintained, contribute  to the generally poor pedestrian experience throughout the  
corridor and reinforce this commercial node as an underperforming heart of the district.   
  
The authorized hearing area is mostly zoned CR Community Retail district (89%), with a  
few parcels zoned CS Commercial Service (7%), RR Regional Retail (0.7%), MU-1 Mixed  
Use –  1 (0.7%), P(A) Parking (1%), and PD 428 (0.7%), but staff is recommending a  
WMU-3  Walkable  Mixed-Use  district  with  a  shopfront  overlay  on  a  portion,  which  is  
compatible  with  WOCAP’s  goal  of  transforming  the  district  into  a  neighborhood-scale  
urban mixed-use district that is pedestrian friendly.   
  
The WMU-3 district not only allows for a variety of housing types and nonresidential uses  
but  offers  urban  design  standards  to  ensure  the  desired  urban  form  including  the  
development types, building  heights and scale that fits into the current context  and are  
compatible  with  and  sensitive  to  the  surrounding  neighborhoods.  Allowing  residential  
uses  other  than  detached  single  family  can  help  create  affordable  housing  options,  
accommodate  a  broader  range  of  incomes  and  household  types,  and  enhance  the  
viability of nearby retail.  
  
Staff’s recommended WMU-3 district is lowest-intensity of the six Walkable Mixed-Use  
districts, which makes it compatible with the surrounding R-7.5(A) single family residential  
neighborhoods. Thus, it is the most appropriate zoning for the authorized hearing area as  
it is compatible with existing land uses within and adjacent to the district.  
  
The WMU-3 district offers enhanced development standards to promote walkability in a  
pedestrian-friendly environment, which the community expressed a desire for in WOCAP.  
To achieve this objective, future development in the district should adhere to the general  
urban  design  guidelines  of  a  form  district  but  also  follow  guidelines  specific  to  a  
development  type.  The  few  single-family  uses  within  the  authorized  hearing  area  are  
currently non-conforming in a CR district but are granted provisions to allow remodeling  
and the right to rebuild if destroyed by natural disaster or other unintentional act. However,  
a non-conforming single-family structure may not be intentionally demolished and rebuilt  
in the CR Community Retail district. Under the proposed WMU-3 district, a single-family  

                                                        28-20  
  
  

----------------------- Page 530-----------------------

Z189-349(JP)  

residence is not an allowed development  type,  but single-family living is allowed in the  
townhome, stacked-townhome, apartment, and mixed-use development types.   
  

Conformity with the urban design standards is critical, but should a structure become non- 
conforming due to this zoning change, the property owner will be notified prior to adoption  
of  the  new  zoning  and  as  per  Article  XIII,  it  will  not  be  required  to  conform  unless  it  
undergoes major renovation. Major renovation is described in Article XIII as a building  
permit or series of building permits for the  reconstruction, alteration, or modification of a  
building that increases the floor area by at least 35%. Therefore, total additions to existing  
non-conforming structures that are less than 35% of the original floor area existing as of  
the date of the adoption of the zoning change will not need to conform with the zoning.  
However, it  must still  comply with the use and placement requirements and the height  
and elements requirements in Section 51A-13.304 for the development type. Additions  
that are less than 35% of the original floor area are not required to comply with maximum  
setback and minimum story requirements.   
  
Regarding parking, staff has conducted a parking analysis of the existing uses within the  
authorized hearing area, comparing parking requirements under the current zoning (CR)  
and the proposed WMU-3 district. The analysis revealed that most businesses will realize  
parking reduction under WMU-3 district zoning. Changing the zoning to WMU-3 district  
will   allow   businesses   to   count   abutting   on-street   parking   towards   their   parking  
requirements, a provision that is currently not  available under the existing CR zoning.  
Overall, adopting WMU-3 district will  optimize parking utilization, potentially freeing up  
surface  parking  that  could  support  new  businesses  or  be  shared  through  parking  
agreements with surrounding establishments.   
  
Although  staff  recommends  a  straight  WMU-3  base  zoning  district,  there  have  been  
requests  from  some  business/property  owners  to  either  eliminate  minimum  parking  
requirements  in  the  district  or  consider  allowing  greater  parking  reductions  for  legacy  
commercial structures, specifically for the old Tortilla Factory on Clarendon Drive. Both  
requests   would   require   a   Planned   Development   District   (PD),   which   PDD   and  
Transportation would like to avoid.  While a PD can often solve an immediate problem, it  
may lead to unintended consequences such as making amendments to the thoroughfare  
plan very difficult or overburdening property owners when they try to make changes to  
structures as they must amend the PD to make certain changes.   
  
It is important to note that even with the parking reduction achieved under the form district,  
certain  businesses  like  bars  and  restaurants  may  still  not  meet  all  their  parking  
requirements   with   existing   onsite   parking   and   abutting   on-street   parking.   Such  
businesses        should     consider      alternative     parking      arrangements         such     as   parking  
agreements  with  nearby  establishments  that  have  excess  parking.  Additionally,  the  
ongoing citywide parking code amendment is expected to reform parking standards and  

                                                       28-21

drastically reduce, or even eliminate parking requirements in commercial and mixed-use  
districts.  
  
To  enhance  ground-level  retail  activity  and  streetscape  vibrancy,  staff  recommends  
applying a shopfront overlay to the corner of Clarendon and Hampton, establishing them  
as  the  district’s  primary  retail  street  segments.  This  designation  will  ensure  that  new  
development  along  these  key  corridors  incorporates  high-quality  ground-level  design  
elements, such as patios, porches, awnings, frequent entry points, and large storefront  
windows to foster street-level engagement, safety, and a pedestrian-friendly environment.  
Additionally, the shopfront overlay is intended to incentivize the adaptive reuse of older  
legacy buildings that already contribute to the district’s form-based character—structures  
built to the street with over 70% street frontage. By leveraging these existing assets, the  
overlay encourages preservation while promoting vibrant, walkable streetscapes. As part  
of this rezoning initiative, PDD has partnered with the Department of Transportation and  
Public Works (TPW) to improve the public realm through street, parking, and intersection  
redesigns as a part of this rezoning initiative. These enhancements aim to create safer,  
more inviting, and highly walkable spaces that support accessibility and economic vitality  
within the district.  
  
Staff  recommends  maintaining  the  current  CR  and  PD  428  zoning  for  the  northern  
properties, primarily in response to the community’s preference for limiting the scale and  
density of potential multifamily or mixed-use developments. As stated in WOCAP, the  
community’s stated  goal is to keep residential density as low as possible, ideally at 12  
units or fewer.  The two  northernmost lots on both the east and west sides of Hampton  
Road  are  the  deepest  within  the  corridor.  This  additional  depth  allows  for  greater  
development potential, as any future projects on these sites could maximize the permitted  
height and achieve higher density, even with the Residential Proximity Slope (R.P.S.) in  
place.  Through  community  engagement  and  research,  staff  determined  that  the  lots  
located at 315 S Hampton Road, 312 S Hampton Road, and 444 S Hampton Road should  
remain unchanged at this time. Staff believes that any future development proposals for  
these sites should  align  with the broader corridor vision  and  should  be subjected  to a  
public  review  process  to  ensure  the  community  has  an  opportunity  to  evaluate  and  
provide input on potential developments the sites.  
  
Some  establishments  in  the  corridor  may  become  nonconforming  due  to  this  zoning  
change. To address this, staff collaborated with the City Attorney’s Office to develop a  
general notification letter in compliance with SB 929. This letter was sent to all property  
owners and businesses that staff suspected might potentially become nonconforming as  
a result of this proposed zoning change.  Under the proposed WMU-3 zoning, the only  
businesses  that  would  become  nonconforming  are  cell  towers  and  drive-in/drive-thru

restaurants, which would require a Specific Use Permit (SUP), and tattoo parlors, which  
would be prohibited entirely.  
  
The property with deed restrictions (D.R. 190810), located on the southwest corner of the  
area of request, is currently zoned an MU-1 Mixed Use -1 District.  The deed restrictions  
allow most uses in the MU-1  District and limit the number of dwelling units to six (five  in  
the structure located at 2406 Emmett and one located at 2410 Emmett). It also allows the  
structure to achieve a maximum height of 54 feet and four stories. Staff is recommending  
termination of the deed restrictions as the property is proposed to be rezoned to WMU-3,  
which limits the heights of buildings to 50 feet and three and a half stories. Therefore, the  
deed restrictions will become unnecessary. The property is currently occupied by offices  
and a hair salon.
