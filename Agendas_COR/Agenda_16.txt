SUBJECT  Office of Arts and Culture: FY 2025-26 Community Artists Program Guidelines  
  
        On  March 26, 2025, City Council will consider the updated guidelines for the Fiscal Year  
        2025-26  Community  Artists  Program  (CAP).  CAP  provides  artist  services  to  Dallas  
        communities  by  African,  Latinx,  Asian,  Arab,  Native  American  (ALAANA)  and  other  
        individual  artists  and  non-profit  organizations  to  teach,  perform,  and  exhibit  at  host  
        facilities in neighborhoods in the city of Dallas. In FY 2024-25, City Council authorized  
        funding totaling $550,000 that was awarded to 65 artists and organizations under this  
        program.  

        CAP cultivates collaborations between artists and communities. Services are requested  
        of CAP artists and organizations by the community through the Office of Arts and Culture  
        (OAC)  on  an  as-needed,  when-needed  basis.  Any  community  member  or  non-profit  
        organization that is presenting an event that is free and open to the public in the city of  
        Dallas may request a CAP service from OAC. This program was originally known as the  
        Neighborhood Touring Program and has been a service of the OAC since the creation of  
        the department in 1989.  

        The CAP goals are:  

             1.  To provide opportunities for Dallas neighborhood residents and organizations to  
                 have  greater  access  to  the  arts  and  cultural  expression  exposing  them  to  and  
                 educating  them  on  ALAANA  art  forms  and/or  traditions  heightening  resident  
                 understanding  of  the  unique  contributions  of  the  city’s  various  cultures  to  the

Office of Arts and Culture  
Vision  

An equitable, diverse, and connected community, whose residents and visitors thrive through  
meaningful arts and cultural experiences in every neighborhood across Dallas.  

Mission  

The Office of Arts and Culture (OAC) works to enhance the vitality of the city and the quality of life for  
all Dallas residents by creating an equitable environment wherein artists as well as arts and cultural  
organizations thrive; people of all ages enjoy opportunities for creative expression; and all celebrate  
our multicultural heritage.  

Our mission is to support and grow a sustainable cultural ecosystem that ensures all residents and  
visitors have opportunities to experience arts and culture throughout the city.  

Statement on Cultural Equity  

In  Dallas, we envision a city of people whose success and well-being are  not pre-determined by their  
race, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender, social status, zip code, or citizen status. We recognize  
that artistic and cultural expression is fundamental to the development of our identity, as individuals  
and as a community at large. We assert the right for all people to have access to arts and cultural  
experiences throughout Dallas.  

We recognize the historic legacies of racism, overt bias, and injustice that shape our present reality. In  
fact, the City of Dallas’ arts funding originated to support organizations of the Western European  
canon, collectively referred to as “The Big Six.” Going forward, we will strive to support the broadest  
range of art forms and creative producers, considering inclusivity, diversity, and neighborhood impact  
to direct resources equitably to artists and organizations. We will work to build a robust arts  
ecosystem that continually evolves to better reflect the diverse composition of Dallas. Towards this  
end, we recognize and affirm the potential of new and emerging artists and organizations.  

The Office of Arts and Culture will serve as convener and connector to catalyze equity in the policies  
and practices of its partners across the Dallas arts ecosystem. Core to this is leading other  
organizations and private resource providers to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in concrete,  
measurable ways. Annually, the Office of Arts and Culture will summarize its own support for artists  
and arts organizations, highlighting measures of equity and diversity.  

As we work together to create a more vibrant Dallas, the Office of Arts and Culture is committed to  
nurturing the wide diversity of creative culture and experiences that make up this great city.

 FY 2025-26 Community Artist  Program  

The Community Artist Program (CAP) provides artist services to Dallas communities by ALAANA  
(defined below) and other individual artists and non-profit organizations to teach, perform, and  
exhibit at requesting facilities in neighborhoods around the City of Dallas. CAP cultivates  
collaborations between artists and communities. Services are requested of CAP artists and  
organizations on an as-needed, when-needed  basis. The Community Artist Program is  NOT a project-  
based program.  Inclusion on the CAP artist roster does not guarantee that services will be requested.  
CAP artists only receive funds when requests from the community are received, services are  
completed, and complete invoices & evaluations are submitted.  

ALAANA means African, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Native American. This also includes Native Hawaiian  
and Pacific Islander (category as defined by the US Census Bureau).  

ALAANA Organization means an organization whose primary intention, practices, and mission is by,  
for, or about ALAANA artists, cultures, and communities. The word “for” refers to the intention of the  
organization to perpetuate, promote, and present art that is representative of a culture and people  
and/or is given form by artists.  

CAP is funded by City of Dallas taxpayer dollars. As stewards of these public funds, artists are  
expected to uphold the highest standards of ethical responsibility and service excellence, adhering  
strictly to the established guidelines outlined in this document.  

Program Goals  

1.   To provide opportunities for Dallas neighborhood residents and organizations to have greater  
     access to the arts and cultural expression exposing them to and educating them on ALAANA art  
     forms and/or traditions heightening resident understanding of the unique contributions of the  
     city’s various cultures to the community in Dallas.  

2.   To create opportunities for ALAANA artists to participate in events throughout Dallas which  
     showcase and celebrate the community’s unique history, diversity, and varied cultural, racial, and  
     ethnic heritage.  

3.   To provide support and opportunities for arts programing through which ALAANA artists and  
     organizations can teach, perform, and exhibit at requesting facilities in neighborhoods in the city  
     of Dallas.  

4.   To promote collaborations between the arts and community entities, such as business,  
     government, and the non-profit sector, for the purpose of community development.  

Service Types  

There are 2 different types of services that encompass the Community Artist Program:

tradition. Performances must be at least 50 consecutive minutes in length plus set up and break

Workshops – A workshop is a hands-on opportunity to introduce the audience/participants to a  
cultural art form or tradition. Workshops must be at least 50 consecutive minutes in length plus set  
up and break down times.  A workshop series allows the participants to explore the topic in greater  
detail and may include a culminating activity. Workshop series are comprised of workshops extending  
from two to five sessions. Individual workshop sessions will be no longer than 180 minutes each  
without prior approval from the Community Arts Manager.

recipients only receive funds as requests from the community are received, services are completed,  
and complete invoices & evaluations are submitted.

General Application Preparation Tips  

Applications are considered incomplete if supporting materials are not uploaded at the time of  
submission. Incomplete applications will not be moved forward for panel review.  

    •   Begin your application early, and do not wait until the last day to avoid possible technical  
        problems.  
    •   Before you begin the application, read the CAP guidelines, funding application instructions  
        and criteria. If you need clarification, contact the Community Arts staff.  
    •   Make sure you understand the premise of the program and what is expected.  
    •   Develop the application so that it addresses program goals and criteria.  
    •   Complete all required information and submit online support materials (e.g. teaching  
        curriculum, critical reviews, web links, photos, audio and video recordings, etc.).  

                                                  Page 4 of 18                                                         63  

----------------------- Page 77-----------------------

     •   All supplemental materials submitted should reflect the quality of your artistic product. Poorly  
         produced supplementary materials can negatively affect your application score.  
     •   Plan your narrative following the questions and funding criteria. Plan your answers carefully to  
         avoid repetition.  
     •   Write to the funding criteria. Remember all applications are reviewed based on how well the  
         application meets the funding criteria and the programming you have to offer.  
     •   Demonstrate how your programming relates or applies to at least one of the six priorities of  
         the 2018 Cultural Plan.  
     •   Don’t assume. Those who review your proposal may have no knowledge of you/your  
         organization or its programming. Make sure you describe existing and proposed programs in  
         detail. The application should stand on its own merits.  
     •   Avoid generalizations.  Rather than stating, “We have operated a successful series of concerts  
         for the last four years,” use numbers to prove your case. For example, “We have produced six  
         plays with 10-performance runs for the last four years to audiences ranging from 75 to 100  
         per each performance.”  
     •   Proofread.  Before submitting your application, have at least one person proofread it. If the  
         reader has questions, it is likely that the reviewers will as well. Applications that contain  
         frequent typographical errors, poor grammar or misspelled words do not give a positive  
         impression of the applicant.  

Materials for Application  

All applicants (individual artists and organizations) will be  required to  provide a  no-longer-than-three-  
minute video presentation introducing themselves and their craft to the panelists.  This video is in lieu

Application Review & Selection Process  

Review of Applications  

OAC Community Arts staff will first review all application proposals to ensure accuracy, inclusion of all  
material and if the project meets the criteria of the Community Artist Program. Only applications  
meeting the criteria and vetted by OAC staff will move forward to the panel for review. Applicants will  
be notified of funding results on a timely basis after the deadline and processing of the proposals.

----------------------- Page 79-----------------------

After OAC staff review, applications for the Community Artist  Program are evaluated by a community  
review panel. The review panel should, to the greatest extent possible, reflect the diversity of the City  
of Dallas, without sacrificing expertise, knowledge, or demonstrated interest in arts and culture.  

ALAANA and other artists and organizations will be considered to become members of the artist  
roster depending on the demand, type of service proposed, and available CAP funds.  

Nominations to Review Panels shall be provided by interested members of the public, the Arts &  
Culture Advisory Commission, and City staff.  In no instance shall a City employee, Arts & Culture  
Advisory Commissioner, or other City official be a voting member of a review panel.  

Review panel members shall be independent, impartial, and responsible only to the people of the  
City and shall comply with the Code of  Ethics in Chapter  12A of the  Dallas City Code including, but not  
limited to, recusal and disclosure provisions. Panelists should strive to avoid the appearance and risk  
of impropriety.  

The selected panel will review the applications and the virtual presentations. They will then score the  
applications up to 80 points. An administrative score of up to 20 points will be added to the panel  
scores. Details regarding both the Panel Scores and the Administrative Scores are listed below:  

  
Panel scores and administrative scores add up to a possible total score of 100 points  

PANEL SCORES  

Details on the scoring criteria are below.  

     1.   Community  Impact  (30  points) –  Is there a  need of the community for the  particular service,  
           based on how it will increase understanding of the cultural heritage of the participating artist,  
           meet an underserved need in the community, and benefit the community at large?  
  
     2.   Service Standards (25 points) - Is the service well planned and appropriate for the targeted  
          audiences, and does the service offer a quality product that advances the preservation or  
           perpetuation of art forms that are rooted in ethnic/cultural traditions?  
  
     3.   Artistic Qualifications (20 points) – Are the stated qualifications of the artist/organization  
          supported by sufficient documentation of training, professional experience, quality of work,  
           planning skills, a past record of achievement, and potential to carry out the proposed service  
          as an artist representing the City of Dallas?

          aligns with the 2018 Cultural Plan Priorities of Equity and Diversity.

ADMINISTRATIVE SCORING  

  
     5.   Administrative Scoring (20 points) - Administrative scoring is broken down in to three  
           categories:

                          contact OAC Community Arts staff before or during the application period to obtain  
                          a precursory overview and understanding of the program. Scheduled meeting  
                          times must be attended.  

  

                                          Points         Contract/Contact  Compliance  
                                               10        Compliant Contract / Effective Contact

Failure to provide appropriate materials for the panel will result in a reduction of evaluation points,  
up to and including automatic withdrawal of application.  

Selection Process  

Panel and staff scores are forwarded to the Allocations Committee of the Arts & Culture Advisory  
Commission for review. The Allocations Committee recommends the applicants who will be  
contracted for the CAP roster as well as funding levels for each applicant taking into consideration the  
scoring, funding projections, and staff recommendation. If the number of applications warrants more  
than one panel to review, the scores for each review panel group will be normalized for the purpose  
of funding allocation. For applicants with a normalized score of 70% or above, placement on the  
roster is dependent on the allocation and availability of funds and is not guaranteed. An applicant  
whose normalized score is below 70% will not be considered for funding and participation on the CAP  
roster. Normalizing a score means each score is divided by the highest score of the review panel  
group.  

The Allocations Committee recommends a roster of artists and allocations for contract levels based  
on the total available funding budget for the Community Artist Program, the need to provide a  
balance among arts disciplines represented in the program, the capacity of the proposed service to  
meet CAP goals, the needs of underserved communities and other requesting organizations, and  
requests by and/or needs of the community in Dallas.

Variances from these guidelines may be approved by the Director; however, material variances shall  
require City Council approval.  Material variances include:  

• Changes in scoring criteria  
• Non-profit status requirements  
• Status as a Dallas-based organization or artist  
• Changes to ineligible activities  

Artist Services Contracts  

All CAP artists and organizations will be given instructions on scheduling of services, completing  
agreement forms, evaluation forms, and invoices. A signed contract must be completed with the  
Office of Arts and Culture before commencement of services. The contracting process can take  
between four and six weeks depending on each artist’s/organization’s circumstances.  Background  
checks are required of all individual artists.  Non-profit organizations must provide proof of  
Commercial General Liability Insurance, and any other requirements set forth by the Office of Risk  
Management (further details provided in Appendix A). Services are requested of CAP artists and  
organizations from OAC on an as-needed, when-needed basis, and are contracted at set fees as set  
forth in the contract – see Appendix B for further details.  

If you are chosen to be on the CAP artist roster you will need to register as a City vendor if you don’t  
already have a vendor number. Registration forms can be obtained by contacting the Community Arts  
Staff. More information will be given to applicants after being notified of being selected for the CAP  
roster.  

Service contracts (established or probationary) may be terminated for the following reasons:  

     •   Failure to pass background check  
     •   Failure to provide a certificate of insurance (if required)  
     •   Cancellation of insurance  
     •   Excessive unexplained absences (two or more during a fiscal year)  
     •   Excessive unexplained tardiness (three or more during a fiscal year)  
     •   Late paperwork  
     •   Unprofessional/unethical  behavior  
     •   Unresponsiveness (Excessive failure to communicate with OAC staff and CAP requestors for  
         assignment confirmations).  
     •   Any other lawful reason specified in the contract.  

CAP Artists, as recipients of public funds, are held to the highest professional standards. Failure to  
comply with any of the aforementioned requirements constitutes grounds for termination from the  
program.  

Newly selected artists/organizations will be placed on a  probationary period of one year to ensure  
compliance with and fulfilment of program requirements and guidelines. Artists/organizations who  
fail to use at least 50% of their allocated funds by the end of a given fiscal year may have funding  
reduced the following fiscal year if they apply and are selected for the roster.

have not, by May 15, 2025, spent at least 40% of their award.  Reallocation may be a minimum of  
$2,000.00 up to 50% of awarded funds and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  

                                                                                                                1 
Funding awards may range from a minimum of $4,000.00 to a maximum of $30,000.00.     

Artist Evaluation/Final  Report Form  

CAP artists are responsible for submitting an Artist Evaluation/Final Report Form for each service  
provided. Artist Evaluation/Final Report Forms are the reporting mechanism by which data is  
collected from each event to quantify and qualify CAP services provided to Dallas residents  
(taxpayers) by ethnicity, age, attendance, and other information.  Completed evaluation forms will be  
submitted electronically to the Office of Arts and Culture via the web portal. Corresponding invoices  
must be attached to the Artist Evaluation for processing. Emailed invoices submitted separate from  
the evaluation form will not be processed.  

Invoices and Payments  

The artist/organization will submit evaluations and invoices no less than 30 days after completion of  
the service.  Payments will generally be disbursed within 30 business days from  receipt of invoice  by  
the Office of Arts and Culture.  Invoices submitted prior to the date of service will not be accepted.  
Late submission will be tracked and taken into consideration for contract compliance purposes in  
future application cycles.  Evaluation forms and invoices must be submitted via the online portal.  

Final evaluation forms and invoices for the last month of service must be submitted by October 31,  
2026. The City of Dallas shall not be liable for non-payment or delays due to City financial processes  
for invoices submitted after October 31, 2026.  

 Program Criteria & Requestor Guidelines

community on a request and need basis.

   DATE  March 25, 2025                                                                                CITY OF DALLAS  

     TO  Honorable Chair and Members of the Quality of Life, Arts & Culture Committee  

SUBJECT  City Facilities Partners Update – Meyerson Symphony Center  
  
        The City of Dallas Office of Arts and Culture typically contracts with various Dallas-based  
        arts  and  culture  non-profit  organizations  for  two  purposes.  The  most  common  is  
        contracting  for  artistic  and  cultural  services  for  Dallas  residents  and  visitors.  More  
         uniquely, Dallas contracts with select organizations to provide long-term management of  
        City-owned cultural venues. The Office of Arts and Culture (OAC) will provide a series of  
         monthly  memoranda  as  an  update  on  each  of  our  facility  management  partners  in  
        alignment with the Dallas Cultural Plan 2018 initiative to, “increase transparency in facility  
         policies and structures.”  
  
         History and Management of the Meyerson Symphony Center  

  
        Considered one of the world’s greatest orchestra halls, The Meyerson Symphony Center  
        opened  in  September  1989  and  is an optimal space  for concerts,  meetings,  lectures,  
         receptions, weddings, and similar events. The Symphony Center is named for Morton H.  
         Meyerson, the former president of Electronic Data Systems (EDS). EDS founder Ross  
         Perot  offered  a  major  gift  to  ensure  the  building  met  the  high  standards  set  by  its  
         internationally renowned design team: architect I. M. Pei and acoustician Russell Johnson  
        of Artec Consultants. Perot chose to honor his friend and colleague by naming the building  
        for Meyerson, who chaired the original building committee and was instrumental in making  
        the Center a reality. The concert hall is named for Eugene McDermott, co-founder of Texas  
         Instruments. The designation was given in response to a significant gift from the Eugene  
         McDermott Foundation in honor of his memory.  
  
        At the time of its completion through September 2019, the City of Dallas managed the  
        operation of the Meyerson Symphony Center with the Dallas Symphony Association, Inc.  
         (DSA) as its main tenant. On October 1, 2019, the City of Dallas turned management  
        control of the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center over to the DSA as part of a 99-  
        year lease agreement.  

                                                               “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                      Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                     80
