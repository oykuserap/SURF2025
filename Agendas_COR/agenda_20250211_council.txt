              members have been issued laptops for CPOB work related matters.   
  
VI. Dallas Police Department Interim Chief Michael Igo Introduction to CPOB  
     i.      Introduction of Interim Chief Igo. The Chief acknowledges the board, holds for  
             comment, and  will  return  to  share  his vision  at  a  later time.  Chair shares  that  
             quarterly meetings have been set to meet with the Interim Chief.   
               
             Question: David Kitner (District 13): How do we work with the police and ensure  
             that the rank and file buy into what we are doing? What do you think needs to be  
             done to get us in a situation where your Officers understand and appreciate what  
             we are doing and will cooperate with us?   
             Response:   It  is  my  intent  going  forward  to  have  full  communication  and  
             transparency with the team. Sitting with the board and formulating a plan for the  
             direction that department is headed to let DPD staff know is needed.   
               
             Question:  Allison  Grinter  Allen  (District  9):  As  you  take  charge  of  this  large  
             department  in  a  really  large  city,  where  do  you  see  the  main  friction  points  
             between the department and the community? How do you frame that, and what  
             do you see as the best way to go forward as far as the department is?    
             Response:  Tonight’s  briefing  will  shed  light  on  that.  DPD  works  hard  as  a  
             department and will continue to work hard with the community and stakeholders.  

                                                            2

              It is important that he has visibility, that lines of communication are open between  
             the department and community, and that he takes the community’s feedback. It is  
             important  to  bridge  gaps  and  increase  transparency  by  receiving  community  
             feedback and adhering to it .   
               
             Comment: Jonathan Maples (District 2): Expressed to the Interim Police Chief to  
             make  sure  when  meetings  are  set  with  the  board,  please  keep  the  meeting  
             appointments. Just as officers are the face of the police, so is the board, the face  
             of  the  community.  Communication  and  trust  are  something  that  must  exist  as  
             mutual  cooperation.  The  board  will  do  what  they  can  so  it  will  be  a  lasting  
             relationship. Commendation given to Major Greer.  
               
             Comment:  Jennifer  King  (District  10):  N/E  Substation  glad  leadership  was  
             composed  of  two  women.  Commended  Police  Boxing  Gym  and  community  
             interaction. Brought to light that while the board investigates complaints , they also  
             encourage commendations. Gives thanks for service and team.   
  
VII.  Bob Scales Presentation on Racial Disparity in DPD Monthly Arrests by Council       
      District.    
       •   Question: Jonathan Maples (District 2): I've asked the chairman to reach out to try  
           to find out and do a deeper dive into what's going on with the breakdown of numbers  
           for monthly arrests by council district, sex, zip code, December 2024. There is a  
           major problem in disparity. I want to know how to fix it if it’s a matter of over-policing.  
            If it's something else, I want an explanation on how we will address it?  
       •    Mr. Scales is the CEO of Police Strategies LLC and an analysis expert who has  
           experience  working  in  Seattle  with  different  civilian  oversight  groups  looking  at  
           racial disparity issues. He was a deputy prosecutor in King County Washington in  
           the 1990’s and also worked for the US attorneys office, for 14 yrs worked for the  
                                                 st 
           city of Seattle. He was the 1    public safety advisor to the Seattle Mayor, He  also  
           works with the Dalla Police Department (DPD) on their force analysis system that  
           his company built for them. For the last decade,  he has been working with Police  
           Strategies LLC to help law enforcement agencies better understand their data. The  
           data in this presentation was also in response to questions that were sent to him.   
       •    Introduces Police Force Analysis System: based on manually extracted incident  
           reports and extracting over 150 data fields, IAPro Data, and dashboards.   
       •    Reviews Use of Force Data Collection Model  
       •   Analysis of Data: using legal algorithms , the base being the Graham vs. Connor  
           case established by the Supreme Court that  set  a standard for evaluating police  
           use of force.   
       •    Key Findings: Uses of force are linked to arrests: the more arrests a department  
           has the more uses of force they will have.   
       •    Dallas PD – Race of Use of Force Subjects Analysis  
       •    Knowing racial disparities exist in society how can they be reduced? how can they  
           be  reduced  in  the  criminal justice  system?  Scales  concludes  that  if  we  want  to  
           reduce   racial   disparities   in,   law   enforcement   data   we   should   address   the  
           inequalities  and  disparities  in  other aspects  of  society.  And  if  we  do  that,  it  will  
           eventually  be reduced. It may take a long time, but it will eventually reduce racial  
           disparities in, our criminal justice system.

  •   Data addressed board question: Do, do the racial demographics of arrestees differ  
      based on the officer's race? Officer vs arrestee reviewed.   
  •   Race of victims’ vs arrestees reviewed  
        
Question: David Kitner (District 13): Requested copies of data shown at the meeting to  
be provided to Board Members. The 2nd question I have is you said 1/3 of the arrestees  
over that period of time  were  about a hundred thousand people who  are  not Dallas  
residents  . Correct?  Do you have a breakdown of that one 3rd in terms of their racial  
profile?   
Answer: Bob Scales: Yes.  I don't have the data with me, but it's in the data set.   
  
Question: David Kitner (District 13): Does that one 3rd mirror the Dallas profile itself or  
 is it different?  
Answer:  Bob Scales: Off the top of my head, it's different. And obviously ,  it's going to  
 depend on what how far the community is, the demographics in that community, and  
 so forth.  
  •   Review of racial Disparity Methodology explained.   
        
  Question: Allison Grinter Allen (District 9): I often see people arrested because they're  
pulled over because they matched the description of a reported crime suspect, but they  
have nothing to do with that crime, and they end up getting arrested for a completely  
different crime. Would that be reported in your data as a reported crime suspect, or no?   
  Answer:  Bob Scales: yes, but all we're doing now is looking at  general statistics and  
demographics for all reported crimes and all arrests. So, based on what you say, it  
makes sense because if, 60 %. of reported crime suspects are black, we would expect  
the police to have 60 % of their stops of crime suspects probably be black. They might  
not have the right suspect, but they're getting reports of black suspects a lot more often  
than they are Asian suspects.  
  
  Question:  Allison  Grinter  Allen  (District  9):  I  guess  my  question  is,  if  there's  a  
neighborhood and one crime is reported by a black male suspect, and on the basis of  
that report to police, ten black men are pulled over,  seven of whom are arrested. Are  
those arrests linked to that one report of a crime?  
  Answer: Bob Scales:  Again, the data doesn't link individual incidents, but what you're  
saying does make sense because they would be more often looking for black male  
suspects because those are the ones reported by the community more often, but they  
may not be arresting them for the crime that was reported. There's no direct linkage in  
this data set, between arrests and the actual reported crime. So, I can't tell you whether  
they were actually arresting individuals that were actually reported as criminal suspects.  
  •   Dallas PD – Disparity Matrix Reviewed.   
  •   Examined Counterfactual Data  
  •   Examined Court Dispositions: When court suppresses evidence.   
        
 Question:  Allison  Grinter  Allen  (District  9):  Do  we  look  at  that  when  the  court  
 suppresses evidence?  I've seen evidence thrown out a lot and I don't know that gets  
  back to the department. Is there a way for that to get back and does the department  
 track that?  
 Answer:  Interim DPD Chief: We don’t track that.   
                                                     4  

----------------------- Page 15-----------------------

 Mr.  Scales  expressed  Police  Departments  and  prosecutor's  offices  are  not  good  
 collecting data,  but this data would be good for the department to know if they have  
 officers who are higher percentage of declines or higher percentage of suppressing  
 evidence and so forth?  
   
 Question:  Allison  Grinter  Allen  (District  9):   Now,  you  do  data  science  for  the  
 department, right?  
 Answer:  I have a contract with them to do our force analysis system.  
   
 Question:  Allison  Grinter  Allen  (District  9):  Do  you  track  how many  officers  in  the  
 department actually live in Dallas?  
 Answer:  I  have  demographic  data  on  officers  for  age,  race  and  gender,  years  of  
 experience but I don’t have residency information.   
   
 Question: Allison Grinter Allen (District 9):  Is there a way to track and look at society  
 and culture in and amongst the department and what that corporate culture looks like  
 in and amongst the department?  Because if folks are disrespectful or discriminatory  
 with  their  colleagues  and  in  the  workplace,  that's  probably  carrying  over  into,  the  
 community. What is the way that the department tracks that?  
 Answer: Interim DPD Chief: The short answer is we do track that Major Greer puts out  
 a  report  monthly  of  those  top  violations  where  they  either  receive  some  type  of  
 discipline or an allegation in response to their conduct.  
 Major  Greer:  That  information  can be  tracked  through  the  program  we  have  IAPro  
 depending upon what data point we put in or what complaint that we are attempting to  
 identify.  We  can  put  that  information  in  and  it  will  let  us  know  how  many  internal  
 complaints  have  come  about  for  that  certain  behavior,  so  we  can  track  it.  It  just  
 depends on, what we want to ask.  
   
 Question: Allison Grinter Allen (District 9): Do you link that up with exit interviews?  
 Answer:  Interim DPD Chief: We do, often though, however, on those exit interviews,  
 we don't get a lot of comments, so its hit and miss.   
   
    Question:  Allison  Grinter  Allen  (District  9):  When  you  were  talking  about  how  the  
 majority of use of force cases are from white officers because white officers make up  
 the bigger part of the demographics of the department. I was wondering if you have  
 actual breakdowns  of demographics within  the  department  broken  down  by  Patrol,  
 detectives, you know, rank structure and that sort of thing?  
 Answer:  Interim DPD Chief: Yes we do and we can provide that to the Board.   
   
 Question:  David  Kitner  (District  13):  Tell  me  if  i'm  wrong,  you  can't  just  look  at  a  
 monthly report that says there were 70 % Hispanic or blacks that were arrested when  
 they don't mirror the population, so is that fair to say that you have to dig a lot deeper?  
 Answer:  Bob Scales: Exactly, and this is this is just a starting point, right? This is not  
 the end of the analysis, but you have to know where to look.   
   
 Question:  David Kitner (District 13):  Based upon what you have provided to us or  
 talked to the DPD about do you believe there is a potential problem here in terms of  
 blacks and Hispanics or people of color being arrested at a disproportionate number?  
                                                      5  

----------------------- Page 16-----------------------

Answer: Bob Scales: What I can say from the data, again, at a very high level, is that  
there's nothing that I've seen in the use of force or the arrest data that suggests that  
there is a systemic practice of bias policing or racial profiling in the department. That's  
the only sort of conclusion that I can draw from the data, but it's important, even without  
being able to reach any kind of conclusion; it is really important for both the community  
and  the  department  to  understand  the  data.  Where  it  comes  from  and  how  it's  
collected,  and how to analyze it.  Because again, it's the simplistic look at population  
versus arrest or whatever that drives everybody wild and say, look at this disparity. It  
must be due to racial profiling, so we are trying to step back and say there is a lot more  
going on and let’s start looking at it more deeply.

Question:  John  Mark  Davidson  (District  15)  Chair:  Where  can  that  dashboard  be  
accessed? Is that available to the public?  
Answer:  Interim DPD Chief:  Mr. Scales just created this dashboard at my request for  
this meeting to get the feedback and buy them back by the board for this  so we can  
definitely have those discussions and then get that dashboard up at a later time once  
we do have those discussions.   
  
Question:  Dr. Lauren Gilbert-Smith  (District 4):  I appreciate your, detail in the report,  
and I wanted to know if, you were open to  requests from using certain data sets that  
we would have access to?  
Answer: Interim DPD Chief: Obviously we want to be transparent as much as we can.  
There's some legal restrictions obviously being CJIS certified, but I've asked Mr. Scales  
and  Dr. Andercheck bring her on board  as well, to provide whatever data we can,  in  
addition to building out those dashboards.  
  
Question: Jonathan E Maples  (District 2):  Do you know what the racial makeup is of  
 Dallas as it relates to black citizens? What's the percentage of black people in Dallas?  
Answer:  Bob Scales:  I'll have to look back at my numbers. I think it's about 28 %,  
something like that.   
  
Question: Jonathan E Maples  (District 2): What's the percentage of black officers on  
the Dallas police department?  
Answer: Bob Scales:  I don’t have that number.   
Interim DPD Chief:  I'd have to check on that, but I think it's roughly in the mid twenties  
to high 20 %.  
  
Comment: Jonathan E  Maples  (District 2):  I want to make sure you understand why  
this is important to me, personally. 2501 total arrest. 1214 of them are black individuals.  
Then that's roughly a thousand a month. So, 1200 black people have been arrested in  
Dallas over the course of 2024. So,  I'm trying to find out where the discrepancy is. We  
gotta find out why,  it's up to us, and it's so important because that number is so big.  
And I look forward to maybe speaking with you more and picking your brain and you  
picking mine and just try to figure this out. Thank you.  
  
Comment:  Bob Scales: You cannot drive down those disparities by simply looking at  
                                                     6

    the police. There's really nothing you can do to the police department in terms of hiring  
    training, supervision policies that's going to dramatically reduce those racial disparities.  
    We have to  dig deeper and find out the root causes and then address those causes  
    and then the police will just do their jobs, and the racial disparities won't be there.   
      
    Comment: Jonathan E Maples (District 2): I totally agree, it begins at home. But when  
    you look at this number, this bleeds outside of the house, down the street through the  
    neighborhoods and all over the place. Because if this number is this high, I know 75216  
    like the back of my hand. I know 75220 because I went to high school. So,  I know the  
    area, and I know what the area was like 40 years ago when I was in high school. So  
    yes, it starts at home, but also there is another problem because the number's too high.  
    If we're failing as a people, you can come back to me and tell them, hey, we're failing  
    as a people. So, I just gotta need to know.  
      
    Comment:  Bob  Scales:  That's  another important  point, that  I'm  obviously not  from  
    Dallas. I don't know your neighborhoods;  I don't know your zip codes. And all I can do  
    is present you with the data, but I don't have the answers, and I don’t know the solutions  
    and I don't know exactly what's going on in these areas, but I hope that the data can at  
    least begin the discussion and get you started on focusing on the real problem.  
  
        Public Comment / Open Microphone  
        Chair opens for public comment as some individuals were not present earlier.   

         •   Dr. Angel Dur: comment regarding Lynetta May Washington who was murdered  
             in south Dallas on  April 25, 2021. She was walking alone at 11:00 at night in a  
             dark area of the city when she was shot in the center of her forehead from a  
             moving  vehicle.  Despite  officers  being  on  the  scene  and  video  evidence  
             capturing the crime, there are still zero suspects today. The case was even used  
             to pass ordinances targeting car takeovers, yet no progress has been made in  
             solving her murder.  Calling this an accident which has been repeated to me  
             over  and  over  by  the  officers  handling  the  case  defies  logic,  science,  and  
             everything that we know about femicide. The sense of urgency I have to get my  
             mom's case solved is pretty high. How can we ensure your officers feel the  
             same sense of urgency to pursue justice? This case was unassigned after just  
             90 days due to an officer's sudden retirement,  and it took me six months of  
             calling the office.  Are you tracking solved cases compared to caseloads? If I  
             ignored evidence or failed to meet my expectations in my job, I would lose it. I  
             want to thank you for letting me speak tonight. I've already checked the box to  
             have someone follow up with me, and I've submitted a formal complaint to this  
             board as well about my experiences with the officers.   
             Comment:  John Mark  Davidson (District 15) Chair:   Thank you so much,  Dr.  
             Durer. On behalf of the board I wanted to just express our sadness about your  
             mother I'm sorry about that, and thank you for your bravery today to share that  
             story and the questions you asked  are valid, they're great questions, and i'm  
             happy to hear that you have checked the box, you have filed a complaint, and I  
             know the office will do their due diligence and hope to see you again.  

         •   Ms. Shanita Cleveland:  comment regarding awaiting a phone call from CPOB  
             Chair and none was received, do you care. Are you going to  be looking at the  
                                                      7

                arrest for marijuana? Are you going to make sure that they're not, still arresting  
                low level? Upset interim Police Chief did not take a meeting with her at a public  
                safety  meeting.  Aspiring  to  work  with  police  and  give  some  insight  with  her  
                experience in the streets. Thankful for allowing her to speak.   
                Comment: John Mark Davidson (District 15) Chair:  Thank you miss Cleveland,  
                and you asked the question, do I care? And the answer is yes, I do. And I thank  
               you for holding me accountable, I apologize. I said  I was going to  reach out to  
               you, I haven't done that  but thank you for your grace and we'll be in touch and  
               thank you for being here.  
                Comment: Allison Grinter Allen (District 9): We don't generally go through and  
                look at all the arrest data for, for, you know, like just proactively we're sort of a  
                board that depends on complaints, but I can tell you from my experience in the  
                courthouse and really,  it's only about two weeks into the year. I haven't seen  
                any misdemeanor arrests for marijuana yet.  
  
VIII. OCPO Accountability and Transparency Dashboard Presentation   
      Siara Montoya Obasuyi  CPOB Data Analyst  gives presentation. The dashboard  was  
      created to  provide a comprehensive overview of complaint data by giving insight into  
      complaint demographics like age, race or gender, and also display complaint resolution  
      tracking like the investigative route or intake method. It will also showcase the data of  
      the positive feedback or accommodations the officers are receiving . The  project is a  
      collaboration with IAD and DBI for the complaint breakdowns. The data was compiled  
      from the inception of the  OCPO  office to present  day, fiscal year 2022  –  2025.  The  
      dashboard displayed:  Compliant overview maps and stats,  complaint demographics,  
      Complaint  Resolutions,  Commendation  Data.  Co-Presenters:  Dr.  Brita  Andercheck  
      Chief Data Officer and Director of Data Analytics and Business Intelligence expresses  
      the product is not yet  public but are looking to develop it and make sure that it meets  
      the needs of the department, this board as well as our city council.  This provides a  
      comprehensive overview of how complaints are submitted, categorized  and provides  
      insights into the demographics. Tomeka D Morrison, Data Analytics manager provides  
      a live demo.          
        
      Question:  Allison  Grinter-Allen  (District  9) :  I  know  that  we  get  a  lot  of  calls  from  
      members of the public who don't necessarily fundamentally understand the purpose of  
      the office. And so,  I wonder if this, when I'm looking at the map, I'm seeing some hot  
      spots and I'm just really wondering if those are the places where these five to seven  
      people  who  call  us  all  the  time  might  live.  Is  there  a  way  to  look  at  some  of  this  
      demographic and location data while filtering out things that are not just n substantiated  
      complaints but filter out basically the fundamentally not appropriate data.    
     Answer:  Dr. Anderscheck,  Like the chronic or repeat callers who discuss the same  
      issue daily, we can work with the office to examine the data and see if we can drill down  
      to that layer. If something like that feels extraneous or like an outlier, we could discuss  
      removing it.   
       
       
      Question:  Dr.  Loren  Gilbert-Smith  (District  4):  How  soon  will  the  Dashboard  be  
      available to us?  

                                                         8  

----------------------- Page 19-----------------------

 .   Answer: Dr. Anderscheck: We are going to take whatever feedback we hear here this  
     evening.  We're  gonna  discuss  it  with  the  director  and  Sierra  and  see  if  we  can  
     incorporate those things. We will then most likely take it to public safety, see if they have  
     feedback and incorporate it, so we will work with the department to get this up as soon  
     as possible and communicate that back to you all. So our hope is as soon as we can  
     make it to public safety, pending the types of feedback and changes you all would like  
     to see, but we'll definitely let you know.   
   
     Question: John Mark Davidson (District 15) Chair: The only question I have is that we  
     had the,  benefit of sitting into front row seat to how the police is gathering their data  
     currently, and is there anything based on what you heard that they're collecting in the  
     data that you thought this might be good also to add to the OCPO dashboard?   
     Answer:  Dr. Anderscheck:  So I guess the question is, what do we want to include,  
     right? This is a product that the office is designing. Our main goal here is transparency  
     and making sure we're clear to the public about what is happening and what the city is  
     doing about it. If there are other things that might be interesting, we can incorporate  
     those if we have that data available to us. We certainly have a lot of police data available  
     to us 311 data, other sorts of complaints and compliments that we get that may or may  
     not need to be incorporated. This product focused on the data that we get out of the  
     system, the complaint system. And so we didn't include anything else in it but there are  
     absolutely opportunities to provide more information to the public that maybe  related  
     and maybe part of the story.  
       
IX.   Updates on Enhancements to the CPOB and OCPO Websites  
       
           •   Chairman: The board website has now been updated and also includes board  
               member pictures in it. If board members would like to update their photo, please  
               reach out to the office. The next step is sending out a biography.   
           •   OCPO Director:  I just want to add to the chairman's comments. So, when you  
               google,  community  police  oversight,  the  1st  link  that  is  the  board   and  
               commission section of the board's website that section has not been updated. I  
               did send an email to them last night to update that, to make sure. So the 2nd  
               link in the Google search, that has been updated with the banner updating the  
               skyline as well as, just having a brief statement on what the board does and  
               their  name, as  well they  have added a  demographic on  the membership  by  
               gender and  I believe race demographic for the board and then in the member  
               section of that, there's photos that attach to the board and information about  
               their  appointment  and,  how  long  their  appointment  are.  So ,  we  have  two  
               vacancies, so those  two positions, which is districts  seven and eleven do not  
               have photos or information, but the other districts do. So, I just wanted to clarify  
               that and then the meeting section that section of the website has been updated.  
               I am working with, the city on updating the website and the office website, and  
               they told me that it should be fully done by mid-February. So, I was going to wait  
               until that point to do a live presentation showcasing what the website looks like.  
               And get some additional feedback for phase two . We really used examples from  
               Fort Worth you know police monitors website and as well as like Chicago had  
               some accountability website that looks really great and provided some feedback  
               for us to use that as the model.   
                                                        9

                Request: Brandon Friedman (District 14):  This looks great, very pleased with  
                it, very happy, this has been months or years in the making. Just one thing on  
               the,  the  member  section  with  the  photos  and  everything,  we  need  contact  
                information so that when residents want to look up their, appointee on the board  
               to reach out they have an email address.   
        
X.    Introduction of New OCPO Staff   
        
   •   OCPO Director Michele Andre introduced newly hired Communication Advisor Waldir  
      Guerrero  and  Senior  Outreach  Specialist  Alma  D  Perez.  Both  new  staff  members  
      shared their experience and role in the OCPO team.   
  
XI.   Reports / Briefings  
    a.   Director Report                                                                  (Director Michele Andre)   
          •   Director shares she’s happy with new hires and that 4 out of 5 positions have  
              been completed.  I do really want to give a shout out to, policy analysts Sierra,  
              because she really has stepped up and helped in such a short amount of time.  
              We have improved with  Dashboards and Websites. We addressed to not have  
              any technical  issues at meetings and really try to streamline the presentations  
              and not have these gaps. That's something that we have improved and also if in  
              times that we can r reduce the time that the meetings.   
          •    I do want to share one of the last vacant positions  that we have opened, that  
              position had remained open because the person that was selected decided that  
              the role wasn't the right fit for her. We reposted the position immediately and  
              received 117 applications. The applications were reviewed and 9 were submitted  
              for HR to review for qualifications and then proceed with interviews.  In addition,  
              now being fully staffed external staff members will not be needed for assistance  
              with  interviews.  Special  thanks  to  311,  Daisy  Fast, former  interim,  and  Major  
              Greer with the interviews. Everyone has been collaborative and helpful in the last  
              four months.  
          •   We  will  be  reaching  out  to  the  chairs  of  the  public  subcommittee  boards  to  
              schedule  those  recurring  meetings.  So,  we're  going  to  be  reaching  out  to  
              outreach. We will be working on the rules and procedures as they need some  
              revisions as well as reaching out to the city attorneys to assist with the rules. In  
              addition, board trainings we will schedule a meeting so that we can identify which  
              trainings are needed for the board.   
          •   As discussed in the retreat we wanted to move away from personal email and  
              devices. I have worked with ITS to find a solution and they donated 15 laptops  
              to the board to use and we created all  the emails, this was outstanding. I believe  
              tonight we made sure everyone can sign in. You are now able to view materials  
              on SharePoint in preparation for these meetings and make decisions on some of  
              these  independent  review  requests. We have  also  provided accommodations  
              where tonight we allowed board members to come in advance and the review  
              the materials.   
          •    I also want to highlight that, as far as the arrest and activity report is concerned,  
              we  collaborated  with  IAD  major  Greer  and  the  DBD  GIS  team  to  get  some  
              additional  data  for  the  monthly  DBD  arrest  reports  that  are  submitted  to  the  
                                                         10

    board. Some of the suggestion that I made was to request some additional data,  
    such    as    adding    a   pie   graph     displaying     a   percentage      breakdown       of  
    misdemeanors versus felonies, behavior, behavior health incidents by types, and  
    then a summary of offense trends over the three years with percentage changes  
    and then a year-to-date  averages. These were examples that I've looked from  
    the   Oakland   police   Department   Weekly   crime   or   report,   Seattle   police  
    department,  arrest   dashboard   and   the   Tucson   police   arrest   data   that   I  
    recommended. So that the board can have some additional data to look at when  
    we're having these discussions, so that it's not just raw data that we're looking at  
    over time.  
•   Regarding the website, if you have any suggestions or additional things that we  
    can add in addition to the contact information, please let me know so that I can  
    make those recommendations as we make sure that's part of that development  
    plan. If you have any photos, please submit those so we don’t use stock photos.   
•   This evening, we started our meeting with a looping video which also had a QR  
    code  that  goes  to  our  website  how  they  can  thank  an  officer  as  well .  Also,  
    information of our mission and other details. This is something that was not done  
    previously. This was a recommendation by Major Greer.   
•   Outreach we met with communications on things that we could be doing. We're  
    going to be looking at creating some reels and social media posts to get the word  
    out what the office does and then also working on doing some TV interviews to  
    really get my face out and do a multi-phase, awareness campaign.   
•   When the dashboard launches, we will also be issuing a press release to ensure  
    that the community is aware of it. I've noticed in discussions that the City of Dallas  
    doesn't always do a good job of informing residents about new programs and  
    initiatives. We will be exploring different strategies to improve awareness. In the  
    back, you'll find a flyer we recently created that highlights our office, the Office of  
    Community Programs and Outreach (OCPO), and our board meetings.  If you  
    would like some copies, please let us know we will also be reaching out to council  
    districts. So now with the communication advisor, we're going to be sitting down  
    and develop a plan on how to get people to know about what we do .   
•   I would like to express my gratitude to Board Member Maples of District 2 and  
    our policy  analyst  for their  support  during  the  State  of  Black  Dallas  event  on  
    December  19,  which  focused  on  the  Howard  University  School  of  Law  audit  
    project. I had the opportunity to speak at this event, and I truly appreciate their  
    attendance and support.  
•   I have been invited to several upcoming events, including a senior meeting for  
    District 3 scheduled for January 21. The goal of this meeting is to strengthen trust  
    and  accountability  between  law  enforcement  and  the  community.  I  think  the  
    community would like to understand how we can work together to ensure district  
    3 is on the right path  
•   Board member Changa Higgins from District 3 will be receiving an award at the  
    upcoming Generation Action Network's ten-year anniversary gala, scheduled for  
    this Thursday at 6 PM. A few staff members and I will be attending the gala to  
    show our support.  I was invited to participate as a speaker for the panel titled  
    Black and Blue Civil Rights Issues and policing. That's scheduled for Saturday,  
    25 January, at 2:00pm, and that's going to be at the Southwest regional, National  
    Black Law Students Association, and that's going to be at the Marriott.

•   I would like to highlight some of the recent outreach efforts and materials we  
    have created. We developed a "Know Your Rights" flyer, as well as flyers for  
    OCBO and CPOB. Additionally, we created informational brochures and branded  
    banners for outreach. We updated the complaint form, the commendation form,  
    and the independent review request form. Despite being short-staffed, we have  
    accomplished a lot, and we look forward to achieving even more in the future.  
•   I  have  participated  in  several  ride-alongs  with  the  3rd  Watch,  the  Southeast  
    Division, the Southwest Division, and a 4th Watch with the Northwest Division.  
    We plan to resume the ride-alongs for the remaining divisions when the weather  
    warms up, as it is currently quite cold.   
    These ride-alongs have been a great way for me to get to know Dallas, familiarize  
    myself with the divisions, and learn more  about the police department and its  
    culture. I also participated in a ride-along focused on homeless solutions, which  
    was very insightful. It helped me understand the various services provided to the  
    homeless community.   
    Often, people come into our office  looking for assistance, so it was informative  
    for us to see the work being done and identify different places we could refer  
    them to. One of my goals is to create a community resource guide that highlights  
    all the community-based departments. We want to compile a centralized list that  
    we can distribute to people in the community, ensuring they are aware of these  
    valuable resources.   
•   Please inform me of any organizations in your districts that we should consider  
    partnering  with,  as  I  have  previously  requested  from  board  members.  I  am  
    looking  to  collaborate  with  trusted  organizations  and  non-profits  within  the  
    community.  This way we can teach then on how to file complaints.  What's the  
    stakeholders so that we can make sure that we're keeping in mind your district  
    when we're doing the outreach.   
•   We are currently right now I am finalizing an agreement, an educational service  
    agreement with Texas ANMM, University of Law, civil rights clinic, so that we can  
    get some research students to work  on some of the policy research that we're  
    working  on.  So,  we're  almost  done.  We  have  something  drafted.  We're  just  
    waiting for the appropriate people for signature, so we can get that executed and  
    they can start.  I want to let you know that it's a big deal and were  making sure  
    that we're getting some of that, work done. Thank you so much.  
      
    Comment:  John  Mark  Davidson  (District  15)  Chair:  Thank  you.  I  believe  it's  
    important for us, as a board, to pause and recognize our journey, acknowledging  
    the  incredible  achievements  we've  witnessed  over  the  past  few  months.  It’s  
    remarkable.   We   can   all   feel   the   momentum   building.   We’ve   welcomed  
    exceptional  new  staff,  and  there  have  been  significant  advancements  in  
    communication and overall improvements in our operations. This progress can  
    be attributed to our leadership, especially the director, whose impact in her short  
    time here in Dallas has been truly remarkable. On behalf of the board, I just want  
    to say thank you once again.  
      
    Comment: Dr. Loren Gilbert-Smith (District 4): Director, besides being fantastic  
    hiring all these qualified people and then establishing a cooperative partnership  
    with major Greer is just fantastic. Thank you.  
                                              12

b.  Policy Analyst Report                                                     (Policy Analyst Siara Obasuyi)  
    i.       Legislative Briefings   
             a.   Senate Bill 280 & 281: OCPO Policy Analyst Siara Obasuyi presented an  
                 overview  and  analysis  of  the  newly  filed  legislation  also  authored  by  
                  Senator  Miles  seeks  to  enhance  transparency  and  accountability  for  
                 complaints alleging official pressure by police officers, the bill sets retention  
                 timelines,  disclosure  requirements,  and   exceptions   prioritizing   public  
                 access to records and superseding conflicting laws.  Complaints alleging  
                 official oppression under section 3903 of penal code must be retained for  
                 at least five years after the officer's employment ends and summarized into  
                 an abstract or indefinite retention. Complaints and abstracts are classified  
                 as   public  information  with  no   discretionary  exceptions  to  disclosure  
                  permitted under chapter 552 of government code. Additionally, complaints  
                  utilized  in  law  enforcement  investigations  or  prosecutions  remain  fully  
                 accessible to the public.  If Senate Bill 281 goes into effect,  departments  
                  like the Dallas police department will be prompted to establish or update  
                 complaint  retention  systems  to  comply  with  the  bill's  requirements  that  
                 allegations of official oppression be retained regardless of the complaint's  
                  investigative outcome.  
                   
                  Question: Allison Grinter-Allen (District 9):   Have you seen or heard any  
                 stirring on them, anything going on or are we just too early in the session  
                 to really know anything?   
                 Answer:  Policy  Analyst  Siara  Obasuyi:  It  is  early,  but  I  also  have  an  
                  update. It should be in the blue sheet that you have in your binders. I also  
                  have an update that may help answer any questions you may have. So,  
                  bill filing began on 12 November of 2024, and as of today, law makers have  
                 filed 2,613 bills. The 89th Texas legislature will convene or has convened  
                 today  January 14, 2025,  the three bills we are currently tracking can be  
                 found here. So, anything highlighted in blue has a link. So, if you have the  
                 digital copy, you'll be able to click on it. Thousands of bills are filed each  
                 session, including many affecting local governments. A significant number  
                 of  these  bills  will  not  move  forward  to  the  committee.  The  Office  of  
                 community police Oversight will provide updates on the legislation that will  
                  impact Police Oversight in the City of Dallas.   
    
    ii.      Legislative Update   
             a.   Senate  Bill  HB881:  OCPO  Policy  Analyst  Siara  Obasuyi  presented  an  
                  update on this bill that it has made it to committee. Considerations to this  
                  bill has, as such as intent past performance and severity of conduct would  
                  be included in the Chiefs  decision making process. These factors would  
                 carry  weight  in  the  final  determination  to  ensure  fair  and  consistent  
                 decisions. I just want to note that this is the bill about the disciplinary matrix.  
                  I would also like to note they do aim to standardize disciplinary actions for  
                 officers. We will be tracking federal bills as well, so it'll go on the sheet that  
                 you'll be receiving every board meeting.

    iii.     Recommendations from the OCPO regarding IAD Complaint Intake Process.   
                 OCPO  Policy  Analyst  Siara  Obasuyi:  Shares  regarding  a  request  letter  
                 sent to Major Greer, and response. Back in December, we noticed a trend  
                 of duplicate complaints, emails and phone calls from complaints wanting  
                 an update on their complaints. So,  we worked with IAD  sergeant Nancy  
                 Jones  and  major  Greer  to  find  a  solution  to  remedy  that.  We  provided  
                 language   that   would   give   an   estimated   timeline   for   reviewing   and  
                 processing complaints and a notification to the complaint. The suggested  
                 language  in  the  memo  was  approved  by  IAD  Major  Greer  and  will  be  
                 integrated  into  the  Dallas  police  Department's  internal  affairs  division  
                 website complaint form, and ID intake investigative checklist.  
                   
c.   Special Investigator Report                                                                (Greg Huff)  
    i.       Critical Incident Briefing  
             1.   On  January 7, 2025, an officer-involved shooting occurred in the 11000  
                 block  of  Joaquin  Drive.  Special  Investigator  Greg  Huff  provided  an  
                 overview of the critical incident. The Dallas police received six 911 calls  
                 reporting a person pointing a handgun at passing vehicles in the 11000  
                 block  of  Joaquin  Drive.  A  patrol  unit,  consisting  of  Officer  Carnes  and  
                 Officer Lopez Navaro, arrived on the scene at approximately 3:21 p.m. The  
                 officers  issued  verbal commands  to  the  individual,  which  were  ignored.  
                 Officer Carnes fired his pistol three times, and Officer Lopez Novaro fired  
                 his  rifle  once,  striking  the  individual,  who  then  fell  to  the  ground.  The  
                 officers provided aid and was then transported to the hospital in stable but  
                 critical condition. The handgun was recovered at the scene and described  
                 as  a  replica  handgun  specifically  a  Crossman  air  pistol.  The  individual  
                 identified as 52 yr old Michael Alonzo was charged with 3 counts of deadly  
                 conduct. No other injuries reported.   
                 a.  Video clip on police body worn camera footage was shown.   
  
             Question:  Jonathan  E  Maples  (District  2):  Is  it  up  to  the  discretion  of  the  
             officers in the car as to which weapon they want to use when they get out?  
             Answer:  Major  Greer:  Yes,  sir.  Depending  on  the  officer,  they  must  be  
             qualified to carry any weapon they use. Some officers are qualified to carry a  
             patrol rifle, while others are not. If an officer is not qualified to carry a rifle,  
             policy states that they cannot use that weapon. However, if they are qualified,  
             it is ultimately at their discretion to decide whether or not to use it.  
  
    ii.      Consideration  of  Independent  Review  Request  (Special  Investigator

         director,  and she gave, answer for a list of things that she could provide for us to  
         make internal affairs a more transparent place. She gave me that list here, I think  
         maybe about three or four weeks ago, and most of the things that she had on that list  
         were already in place, but it doesn’t mean that they didn’t need to be enhanced and  
         available  to  the  public.  We’re  going  to  implement  everything  that  is  on  that  list,  
         secondly, we're going to enhance our, our website, and we're working with the OCPO,  
         to make those enhancements to the website  so citizens  have direct access to get  
         information they need and easy access.   
         IA Pro: Public portal is in the works and as soon as it is made public you will be the  
         first to know about it and demo for you. We are making progress with IT’s approval  
         process. Literature is being created to inform the public regarding what internal affairs  
         does. The new information updated will be forwarded to the director. I want to extend  
         an invitation to anyone on the board to come to internal affairs any  time, well take  
         you through the process any questions that you have, open book, you can see it for

 SUBJECT     Officer-Involved Shooting – Critical Incident #2025-001, January 7, 2025  
              
  
  
  
            On January 7, 2025, at approximately 3:15 PM, the Dallas Police received six 911 calls about a  
person in the 11000 block of Joaquin Drive who was pointing a handgun at passing vehicles. A patrol  
unit, carrying Officer Cairns and Officer Lopez-Navarro, arrived on the scene at approximately 3:21 PM  
and observed an individual pointing a gun at a vehicle. The officers issued verbal commands, which the  
person ignored.   
  
Officer  Cairns  fired  his  pistol  three  times,  and  Officer  Lopez-Navarro  fired  his  rifle  once,  striking  the  
individual, who then fell to the ground. The officers provided first aid until rescue personnel arrived. The  
individual, identified as Michael Alonzo, a 52-year-old Hispanic male, was transported to the hospital,  
where he was listed in stable but critical condition.  
  
The  handgun  used  by  Alonzo  was  recovered  at  the  scene  and  was  identified  as  a  replica  firearm,  
specifically  a  Crossman  air  pistol.  Alonzo  has  been  charged  with  three  counts  of  deadly  conduct.  
Fortunately, no other injuries were reported during this incident.

Dallas County Sheriff Department Inmate Property Forms:  
The  Dallas  County  Sheriff  Department  Inmate  Property  form  (Attachment  -  F)  dated  
November 10, 2022, at 3:28 am, was signed by William Black.  This property sheet had  
preprinted items listed along with a section to handwrite items in.    
  
The following preprinted items were circled on the form:  
     •   Head Rags,   
     •   Tobacco Products  
     •   Lighter  
     •   Knife  
     •   Phone  
     •   Phone Case  
     •   ID Card  
     •   Keys  
  
The following items were handwritten on the form:  
     •   Yellow Watch  
     •   Yellow Necklace  
     •   Black Wallet w/misc Cards  
     •   Rubber Bracelet  
     •   1-Black Bracelet  
     •   1-White Bracelet  
     •   1-Yellow Rings  
     •   Total Money - $180  
  
A second property form in the file was a computer printout of listed items.  This property  
sheet was dated  November 10, 2022, at 1906 (7:06  pm).  This property sheet listed the  
same items as indicated on the handwritten sheet except for the necklace.  This printout  
indicated there were 2 necklaces, 1-with a cross and 1-with a stone.  The signature line  
on this second form was blank.   
  
Investigator Huff spoke to Dallas County Sheriff Deputy Robbins #1298 in reference to  
the two different property forms.   Deputy Robbins had no knowledge of this incident but  
stated the first handwritten form is completed in Central Intake when an officer brings an  
arrestee in to be booked.  The form is completed by a  Dallas County employee and is  
signed by  the arrestee.    When  the  arrestee  is moved  upstairs  for  “book-ins”,  another  
employee  examines the property and inputs it into the computer.  He explained that is  
why there is a large time difference between the forms.   Deputy Robbins advised they  
would not have video from this incident since it occurred in 2022.  He advised the video  
retention period is 90 days.    
  
Public Integrity Unit Executive Summary:  
On December 29, 2022, Dallas Police Internal Affairs Division sent Black’s complaint to  
the  Dallas  Police  Public Integrity  Unit  to  be investigated  for  possible  criminal  conduct  
(Attachment - G).

----------------------- Page 34-----------------------

According  to  the  Public  Integrity  Unit  (PIU)  report  (Attachment  -  H)  dated  5/17/23,  
Officers Farmer, Johnson, Osemwenkha and Djigal were investigated for the allegation  
of theft based on the complaint from Black.  Complainant Black gave PIU a statement on  
January 6, 2023.  During that statement he alleged he was only pulled over because he  
was wearing a Cuban link necklace.  Black said he felt it was strange that Officer Johnson  
only removed the Cuban link necklace from his neck.  Complainant Black provided PIU a  
Dallas County Jail property receipt which listed several items to include, “2-Necklace 1/w  
a  cross  and  1  w/stone”.    Black  stated  his  girlfriend,  Heather  Crocker,  picked  up  his  
property from jail and she had advised him the Cuban link necklace was not with his  
property.    
  
The PIU investigation stated that the necklace was tracked on Body Worn Camera and  
Dash Cam from the time it was removed from Black’s neck until the officers pulled into  
the Dallas County Jail sallyport.  PIU attempted to obtain the video at Dallas County Jail,  
however  they  have  a  90-day  retention  period  which  had  expired.    The  Dallas  Police  
Officers  were  interviewed  by  PIU  all  denied  any  knowledge  of  what  happened  to  the  
necklace.   
  
PIU concluded that there were multiple Dallas Police Officers and Dallas County Sheriff  
employees who would have had access to Black’s necklace and therefore there was not  
enough probable cause to show that Officers Farmer, Johnson, Djigal and Osemwenkha  
had committed theft.    
  
The case was then sent back to the Internal Affairs Division to conduct the administrative  
investigation.  
  
Internal Affairs Division Summary:  
According to the  Internal Affairs Division report  (Attachment  -  I) dated  November 13,  
2023, it was concluded that the allegation of failing to properly secure prisoner’s property  
was  Unfounded  for  Officer  Johnson  and  Officer  Farmer.    The  allegation  of  failing  to  
properly  secure  prisoner’s  property  was  Sustained  for  Officer  Gjigal  and  Officer  
Osemwenkha.    
  
However,  when  this  report  was  routed  through  the  chain  of  command  for disciplinary  
approval it was recommended the finding be changed to Not Sustained due to the Dallas  
County  Sheriff  video  not  being  retained  and  due  to  Dallas  County  Sheriff  employees  
possibly having access to the necklace when Black was booked.  In a letter dated January  
31, 2024, then Assistant Chief Michael Igo reclassified the findings in case CN2022-375  
to “Not Sustained” (Attachment - J).    
  
On February 2, 2024, the Dallas Police Department’s Internal Affairs Division sent Black  
a letter advising him the investigation was unable to establish a violation of departmental  
rules  (Attachment  -  K).    The  letter  also  advised  he  had  30  days  to  request  an  
independent review of the case by the Office of Community Police Oversight.

On February 29, 2024, Black submitted an independent review  request to the Office of  
Community Police Oversight for a review of his case (Attachment - L).  
  
Further Investigation:  
On January 17, 2025, at 11:22am, Investigator Huff interviewed Heather Crocker at the  
OCPO office.  Crocker is the wife of William Black.  Crocker advised that a few days after  
Black’s arrest, he authorized her to pick up his property.  Crocker said there were two  
sealed bags.   One bag had a handwritten property form in it along with his jewelry.  The  
other bag had a computer printout of his property along with his wallet and phone.  Neither  
bag contained the Cuban necklace.  
  
During this interview, Crocker was able to get William Black on the phone who is currently  
incarcerated.  Black advised when he got to the jail a deputy took the rest of the property  
off of him.  Black stated that at the booking window he noticed the Cuban necklace was  
not with the other property that had been taken off.  Black said he asked the transporting  
officer about the missing necklace and the officer stated it would be in his property.  Black  
described this transporting officer as a black officer who was not one  of the arresting  
officers.  Black said that while he was getting  booked,  he also saw the arresting officer.   
Black asked the arresting officer about his necklace and the arresting officer said it would  
be in his property.  Black said the handwritten property form is the form he signed when  
he was getting booked and that form was completed by a deputy at the jail.    
  
Investigator Huff asked Black about the statements he made at the time of his arrest when  
he advised the necklace wasn’t worth anything.   Black confirmed he said that,  and his  
intention was to downplay the worth of the necklace in hopes the officer would not remove  
it from his neck.  Black reiterated that the police officers who he encountered that night  
all treated him very well and he had no issues with them.  Black said the necklace was a  
family heirloom and he just wants to get the necklace back.    
  
Policy Review:  
Dallas Police Department Code of Conduct, section 6.8:  “Employees shall take all  
reasonable  steps  necessary  to  prevent  loss  or  damage  to  property  or  equipment  
belonging to a person in custody, or which has come into possession of said employee  
by reason of their office.” (Attachment - M).   
                                                             
                                           Findings & Conclusion  
  
Summary of Investigation  
The Office of Community Police Oversight has determined that the allegation of failing to  
properly secure a prisoner’s property (as outlined in the Dallas Police Code of Conduct,  
Section 6.8) is Not Sustained. This decision was made due to the involvement of multiple  
agencies in handling the property, as well as the lack of crucial video evidence from the  
Dallas County Jail.

         Incident Summary  
           
         Complaint:  

         On  September  7,  2023,  Javar  Wright  submitted  a  complaint  to  the  Dallas  Police  
         Department. In his complaint, he alleged that in 2022, Detective Deleon took a statement  
         from  Wright's  ex-girlfriend, Amanda  Berkhalter,  regarding  a  harassment  incident  that  
         occurred  in  2020.  Wright  claims  that  Berkhalter  misrepresented  the  nature  of  their  
         relationship.  He  further  alleges  that  Detective  Deleon  did  not  conduct  a  proper  
         investigation and failed to reach out to him to obtain his version of events.   

         Wright  believes  that  Berkhalter's  relationship  with  an  officer  in  the  Dallas  Police  
         Department may be the reason why Detective Deleon did not contact him. Due to the  
         alleged  lack  of  investigation  by  Detective  Deleon,  Wright  is  currently  facing  criminal  
         charges in Denton County.  

         Police Report:  

         On  February  13,  2021,  at 2:53  pm, Amanda  Berkhalter  reported to  the  Dallas  Police  
         Department  that  she  was  driving  home  when  her  ex-boyfriend,  Javar  Wright,  began  
         following her.  Wright blocked Berkhalter’s vehicle with his vehicle and began tapping on  

                                                                 “Service First, Now!”

her window in an attempt to talk to her.  Wright started honking her horn until the Wright  
left.  Officer Turner took this statement of Berkhalter.    

A supplement report indicated:  

          “The I/O contacted the compl and left a message with a call back number.  The  
          I/ O  has  not  heard  back  from  the  compl  regarding  this  case.    CBEA  this  
          offense.”  

Internal Affairs Division Investigation:  

The  Internal Affairs Division  investigated Wright’s complaint and confirmed that  Senior  
Corporal Deleon  had been assigned to a harassment case involving Berkhalter as the  
victim  and  Wright  as  the  suspect.  However,  Detective  Deleon  was  unable  to  contact  
Berkhalter, leading to the case being closed without charges.  

During the investigation:  

    •    Senior Corporal Deleon stated he was unaware of any Dallas Police Officer related  
         to Berkhalter.  

    •    Internal Affairs Division identified Officer Wayne Warrens as related to Berkhalter  
         (non-blood-related cousin). Warrens stated he was aware that Berkhalter had been  
         a victim of harassment for years but was not involved in her case and did not know  
         the assigned detective.  

    •    Berkhalter  told  Internal  Affairs  Divisions  she  had  never  spoken  to  Detective  
         Deleon.  

    •    Detective  Matthew  Hebert  was  identified  as  being  assigned  to  a  separate  
         harassment  case  involving  Berkhalter  and  Wright.  Hebert  attempted  to  contact  
         Wright by phone but was unsuccessful. Based on ongoing reports from Berkhalter,  
         Detective Hebert obtained an arrest warrant for Wright.  

On December 12, 2023, Internal Affairs Division notified Wright that:  

          “…the investigation was unable to establish a violation of departmental rules.”  

OCPO Preliminary Review:  

On January 7, 2024, Wright requested an independent review by the Office of  
Community Police Oversight (OCPO). (His request form was dated January 7, 2023,  
but this was determined to be a typographical error, as his original complaint was filed in  
September 2023.)  

During OCPO’s preliminary review:  

    •    No evidence was found indicating a violation of Dallas Police Department  
         policies and procedures.  

                                                 “Service First, Now!”

•    No evidence was found supporting allegations of an improper investigation by  
     Senior Corporal Deleon.

     improperly influenced the investigation.

Police Report:  

According to the police report,  on June 23, 2023, Fletcher Daeja along with her friend,  
Jade Geter, responded to the apartment of Marilee Donaldson to pick up  the  property.   
Donaldson was at the apartment with Alfred George.  Upon arrival, a subsequent fight  
occurred in the parking with all 4 parties.  Geter called the police, and Officer Leach and  
Officer  Mercedes  responded.  All  4  parties  reported  to  the  police  various  accounts  of  
pushing and hitting that occurred. The police report listed injuries to Geter as bruising and  
swelling on her left arm, chest,  and back.  No other injured parties were documented.   
Donaldson and Geter had been roommates at the apartment for the past three weeks.  
The officers determined that Donaldson and George had committed assault, and they  
were  subsequently  arrested  and  transported  to  ja il  to  prevent  further  acts  of  family  
violence from occurring.

18:00:06           Officer  Mercedes  explains  to  Ocell  Donaldson  the  decision  process  in  
                   making the arrest.  
  
18:01:33           Officer Mercedes advises  Ocell  Donaldson  that  he  is interfering  with  his  
                   investigation, and if he doesn’t leave, he will be arrested.   
  
18:02:38           Ocell Donaldson requests the names of all the officers on the scene  and  
                   says he will leave when he gets the names.   
  
18:04:41           Officer Mercedes hands Ocell Donaldson a list of the officer’s names who  
                   were at the scene.  Officer Mercedes says to Donaldson, “You got what you  
                   need.”   
                   Donaldson replies, “I can still stand here and talk, bro”.  Officer Mercedes  
                   explains that is okay as long as he doesn’t interfere with the investigation.

18:15:56           Marilee Donaldson can be heard on video calling herself fat.  At this time,  
                   Officer  Mercedes  walked  by  Ocell  Donaldson  and  looked  at  him.  Ocell  
                   Donaldson asks Officer Mercedes why he was looking at him like that and  
                   if he thought his daughter was lying.   Officer Mercedes replied, “No, you  
                   good.” Ocell Donaldson then continues to accuse Officer Mercedes of giving  
                   him a “fucked up” look when his daughter said she was fat.

                   of this patrol vehicle.   
  
Internal Affairs Division Preliminary Review:  

On July 7, 2023, Dallas Police IAD responded to Ocell Donaldson’s complaint with a “No- 
Investigation”  letter.    The  letter  stated  that  complaints  against  police  officers must  be  
made in writing and signed by the person aggrieved.  The Internal Affairs Division of the  
Dallas Police Department cannot initiate an investigation based on "third-party" complaints.

         Complaint Submitted Via: Online Submission Form

              1.   Officer Jamilah Muhummud #11871

         Incident Summary  
           
         Complaint:  

         On November 30, 2023, Javar Wright filed a complaint with the Dallas Police Department,  
         alleging that Officer Jamilah Muhummud refused to take his information regarding a 2020  
         crime  report  (Report  #166985-2020)  in  which  his  ex-girlfriend,  Amanda  Berkhalter,  
         allegedly provided false information.  

         Wright claimed that when he contacted Officer Muhummud on November 30,  2023, to  
         provide proof that Berkhalter had lied in the 2020 report, Officer Muhummud refused to  
         document his information and told him to “let the courts figure it out.”  

         Police Report:  

         Wright referenced Police Report #166985-2020, which was generated on September 19, 2020,  
         and  classified  as  a  “miscellaneous  incident  report,  no  offense.”  This  report  documented  that  
         Berkhalter reported Wright was  refusing to leave her residence  after staying there for several  
         months. Berkhalter was advised she would need to go through the  eviction process to remove  
         him.  

                                                                  “Service First, Now!”  
                                                         Connect – Collaborate – Communicate  
           

----------------------- Page 44-----------------------

A  second  police  report,  #212940-2023,  dated  November  30,  2023  (the  same  day  as  
Wright’s  complaint),  was  also  reviewed.  This  report  was  similarly  classified  as  a  
“miscellaneous incident report, no offense.”  

This report documented:  

     •   Wright stating, he had  ongoing legal cases with Amanda Berkhalter  and that the  
         charges against him were false.  

     •   Wright claiming, he had proof of his innocence but that nobody would listen to him.  

     •   Wright requesting a police report to document his claims.  

Internal Affairs Division Preliminary Investigation:  

The Dallas Police Department Internal Affairs Division  reviewed Wright’s complaint and  
sent him a response stating:   

           “The Dallas Police Department does not routinely investigate allegations that  
           are not submitted for review within sixty days after occurrence.”  

However, Wright disputed this response, arguing that his complaint was filed on the same  
day as the alleged incident (November 30, 2023) and not beyond the 60-day timeframe  
referenced in the letter.  

OCPO Preliminary Review:  

On  January  7,  2024,  Javar  Wright  requested  that  the  Office  of  Community  Police  
Oversight (OCPO) to review his case. Although the request form was dated January 7,  
2023, this was identified as a typo, as the original complaint was filed in November 2023.  
Wright   clarified   that   the   incident   in   question   occurred   on   November   30,   2023,  
contradicting the Internal Affairs letter, which stated it happened over 60 days prior.  
  
During a preliminary review, the OCPO confirmed that a report regarding the incident was  
written on November 30, 2023, in response to Wright’s request. However, the OCPO  
found   no   evidence   of   violations   of   the   Dallas   Police   Department's   policies   and  
procedures.

          employees and include the percentage residing within the Dallas city limits.

          employees and include the percentage residing within the Dallas city limits by rank.  
     3.   Officer Demographics: Provide a detailed breakdown of the number of officers and the  
          percentage that resides within Dallas city limits, categorized by rank, race, ethnicity, and  
          gender.  
     4.   Division and Units: A breakdown of the  above data  by  division  or units to which these  
          officers and DPD civilian employees are assigned.  

We recognize the sensitivity of this request and trust that the information provided will adhere to  
all applicable privacy laws  and policies. If necessary, we are happy to discuss any measures  
required to maintain compliance while fulfilling this request.

Police Department and the communities within the City of Dallas.

SUBJECT   Briefing of House Bill 909  

   This memorandum provides an overview of House Bill 909 (HB 909), which seeks to reform  
   law enforcement policies in Texas. This legislation aims to increase accountability, regulate  
   the use of force, and establish new legal standards for public entity liability. A key provision  
   of HB 909 is to prevent police misconduct and enhance public trust in law enforcement.  

   Key Provisions:  
         •    Public Entity Liability: Public entities, including state and local governments, will  
              be held liable for wrongful actions committed by their peace officers acting under the  
              color  of  law.  The  bill  eliminates  qualified  immunity  as  a  defense  in  civil  lawsuits  
              related to civil rights violations.  
         •    Use-of-Force Restrictions: The use of chokeholds, carotid artery holds, and similar  
              neck restraints are prohibited  unless necessary to prevent imminent serious bodily  
              injury or death.  
         •    Duty  to  Intervene:  Officers  are  required  to  intervene  and  report  incidents  when  
              witnessing a colleague using excessive force.  
         •    Disciplinary Matrix: Law enforcement agencies must adopt a standardized system  
              for disciplining officers, ensuring consistent consequences for misconduct.  
         •    Cite-and-Release  Policy:  Law  enforcement  agencies  must  implement  policies  
              mandating the  issuance of  citations instead of arrests for fine-only misdemeanors,  
              except in cases such as assault or public intoxication.  
         •    Use-of-Force Training Reforms: Officers must  undergo training  emphasizing  de- 
              escalation techniques, intervention duties, and cautionary use of deadly force.  
         •    Public Disclosure Requirements:  Petitions, judgments, settlements, and consent  
              decrees related to law enforcement misconduct cases must be publicly disclosed.  

   Impact:   
   If enacted, HB 909 will  eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement officers, holding  
   public entities like the City of Dallas legally responsible for wrongful actions committed by  
   officers  performing  their  official  duties.    This  bill  aligns  with  the  national  de-escalation  
   standard  by imposing strict limitations on use-of-force  and  a ban on  chokeholds except in  
   life-threatening situations. Additionally, officers will be required to undergo additional training  
   in de-escalation techniques, adhere to the duty to intervene in excessive force cases, and  
   mandate  public  disclosure  of  misconduct  records.  Furthermore,  the  bill  also  revises  
   procedures for handling low-level misdemeanor offenses, requiring officers to issue citations  
   instead of making arrests for fine-only infractions.  

     

                                                                  “Service First, Now!”

SUBJECT  

         Plan  
          
         Civilian oversight of law enforcement is essential for ensuring accountability and fostering  
         public trust, particularly in the wake of high-profile incidents. The Office of Community  
         Police Oversight (OCPO) remains committed to enhancing transparency, credibility, and  
         legitimacy  through  strategic  community  outreach  efforts.  This memo  outlines  OCPO’s  
        comprehensive  Community  Outreach  and  Engagement  Plan  designed  to  strengthen  
        community engagement, build trust, and improve oversight effectiveness. By increasing  
        awareness, gathering input, and prioritizing historically underserved communities, OCPO  
        seeks to establish a foundation for constructive relationships between law enforcement  
        and the public.  

        Abstract  

         Outreach plays a critical role in raising awareness, sharing reports, building relationships,  
        and  gathering  community  input.  These  efforts  enhance  OCPO’s  transparency  and  
         legitimacy while fostering coalition-building with stakeholders. This memo provides an  
        overview of OCPO’s ongoing work to finalize a strategic plan that will define outreach  
        goals, methods, and key performance indicators to measure progress.  

         Goals  

        The community outreach efforts aim to:  

             •    Raise  awareness  about  OCPO  and  the  Community  Police  Oversight  Board’s  
                  (CPOB) mission and purpose.  
             •    Collect meaningful input from community members and stakeholders.  
             •    Engage historically underserved and underrepresented communities.  
             •    Build trust with the public and encourage support for oversight initiatives.  

        Strategies and Methods  

             •    Networking:   Strengthen  connections  with  key  stakeholders  and  grassroots  
                  networks to expand outreach efforts and increase support for civilian oversight.  
             •    Messaging and Marketing: Use clear, accessible communication across various  
                  media channels to educate the public on civilian oversight functions.  
             •    Outreach  and  Engagement:  Establish  15  Outreach  Zones  aligned  with  city  
                  council  districts  to  address  community  needs  and  promote  participation  in  
                  oversight efforts.  

                                                               “Service First, Now!”

                •   Conduct surveys, focus groups, public meetings, and community forums to gather  
                    feedback.  
                •   Maintain  an  engagement  calendar  and  compile  insights  from  stakeholders  to  
                    inform future outreach efforts.  

           OCPO’s   Community   Outreach   and   Engagement   Plan   is  designed   to   promote  
           transparency, accountability, and stronger relationships between the community and law  
           enforcement.  By  implementing  these  strategies,  we  aim  to  enhance  public  trust  and  
           ensure meaningful civilian oversight. We will be providing the finalized plan to you in the  
           coming weeks and welcome your feedback to refine and strengthen its implementation.

    Introduction   
      
    Civilian  oversight  of  law  enforcement  often  emerges  in  response  to  community  
    demands for greater accountability, especially following high-profile incidents. As an  
    institution  dedicated  to  representing  community  interests,  civilian  oversight  bodies  
    must  actively  engage  with  local  communities  and  stakeholders.  Effective  outreach  
    raises awareness of the Civilian oversight's role, facilitates the dissemination of reports  
    and  findings,  strengthens  relationships  with  stakeholders,  encourages  community  
    input, and enhances the Civilian oversight's problem-solving capacity. These efforts  
    are   essential   for   promoting   the   Civilian   oversight's   transparency,   institutional  
    legitimacy, responsiveness, accountability, accessibility, and public trust.  
       
    This Community Outreach and Engagement Plan provides a systematic approach for  
    identifying  community  partners,  developing  educational  materials,  utilizing  social  
    media   as   a   communication   tool,   and   encouraging   individual   and   community  
    participation. The primary object is to increase awareness of the Office of Community  
    Police Oversight (OCPO or Office), the Community Police Oversight Board's (CPOB  
    or Board), and the processes for submitting complaints and commendations. This plan  
    enhances  transparency  and  accountability  while  cultivating  strong,  collaborative  
    relationships between the community and the DPD.  
       
    Community Outreach and Engagement Goals   
    The goals of our public participation efforts are to:   
       
         1)  Raise awareness about the OCPO and CPOB’s mission and purpose;   
        2)  Collect meaningful input from community members and stakeholders;   
        3)   Involve and consult communities who have been historically underserved and  
             underrepresented or subject to discrimination and police misconduct and;   
        4)  Build  trusting  relationships  with  the  public  and  seek  their  approval  of  the  
             strategies proposed in our plan.   
       
    This outreach plan outlines a comprehensive set of strategies and methods to achieve  
    our objectives while ensuring alignment with the structured process we will follow to  
    develop and implement the plan effectively.  
      
    Background    
      
    Following the tragic murder of Botham Jean by Dallas police officer Amber Guyger,  
    activists and members of the  civilian  review board called on the city to establish an  
    independent  investigative  body.  They  advocated  for  a  properly  funded  and  staffed  
    entity   capable   of   conducting   thorough   reviews   of   citizen   complaints,   ensuring  
    transparency, publicizing findings, and recommending restorative policy. In April 2019,  
    seven  months  after  Jean's  murder,  the  Dallas  City  Council  established  the  OCPO  
    through Ordinance No. 31192 under Article XXII, Chapter 2 of the Dallas City Code. Its  
                                                                                                                  Page 2 of 12

primary purpose is to provide support and technical assistance to the CPOB, formerly  
the  Civilian  Review  Board. The  OCPO  aids  the  CPOB  in  ensuring  that  complaints  
against DPD officers are thoroughly and impartially investigated through independent  
reviews and investigations, reinforcing accountability and public trust.  

Mission Statement   

The mission of the OCPO is to ensure civilian complaints are reviewed impartially to  
enhance  the  transparency  and  trust  between  the  City  of  Dallas,  the  Dallas  Police  
Department, and the community. To achieve its mission, the OCPO accepts complaints  
and  commendations  filed by members of the public . A key function of the OCPO  is  
educating  community  members  on  police  complaint  procedures  and  processes  to  
empower  individuals  to  understand  their  rights  and  the  steps  involved  in  filing  
complaints against police officers. This educational component is essential in ensuring  
community  members  feel  heard  and  supported  when  raising  concerns  about  law  
enforcement  practices.  In  addition  to  educating  the  public,  the  OCPO  facilitates  a  
mediated  resolution  process between  complainants  and  Dallas  police  officers. This  
process allows for constructive dialogue and the potential for mutual understanding,  
addressing  concerns  to  promote  accountability  while  strengthening  relationships  
between officers and the community.   

The  OCPO  also  plays  a  crucial  role  in  overseeing  IAD  investigations  into  external  
administrative complaints. By ensuring these investigations are conducted thoroughly  
and  transparently,  the  office  helps  to  uphold  the  integrity  of  the  complaint  review  
process. Additionally, the Director of the OCPO monitors the DPD’s investigations into  
critical incidents involving Dallas police officers. These incidents, which may include  
officer-involved  shootings  or  cases  of  serious  misconduct,  require  independent  
oversight to ensure impartiality and adherence to proper investigative procedures. By  
actively overseeing these investigations, the OCPO reinforces the principles of justice  
and transparency, which are essential for maintaining public trust. Through its various  
functions, the OCPO serves as a bridge between the community and law enforcement,  
ensuring  that  complaints  and  concerns  are  handled  fairly  and  that  the  policies  
governing police conduct reflect the values of accountability and integrity.    

Vision Statement   
  
Building  a  foundation  of  trust  and  collaboration  between  law  enforcement  and  the  
community while reinforcing transparency and accountability.  
  

Strategies and Methods   
   
Strategy 1: Networking  
  
Develop  a  comprehensive  list  of  key  stakeholders to  engage,  including  community  
members,  local  organizations,  civic  groups,  businesses,  and  representatives  from  
                                                                                                            Page 3 of 12

diverse  communities.  This  initiative  aims  to  form  strategic  alliances  with  local  
organizations, community leaders, and other stakeholders to enhance outreach efforts  
and broaden the influence of the civilian oversight body.    
   
Ongoing engagement and support from stakeholders regarding local public safety and  
law  enforcement  issues  are  crucial  for  the  oversight  body's  effectiveness.  While  
establishing and supporting civilian oversight may be politically advantageous during  
a  crisis, sustained interest and support from stakeholders who value independence,  
accountability, and transparency are essential for successful oversight. An oversight  
body’s ability to sustain support often depends on the effectiveness of its outreach  
efforts to key stakeholders.   
    
Our office will work to develop a citywide grassroots network infrastructure to enhance  
community engagement and coordinate outreach efforts. These networks will be vital  
for  organizing  virtual  town  halls,  in-person  meetings,  and  other  events  to  raise  
awareness. The OCPO Outreach Team will also create a database to collect contact  
information  from  community  organizations  and  track  outreach  activities  using  an  
engagement calendar for all 15 council districts.   

Strategy 2: Messaging and Marketing  
  
Maintain  clear  and  concise  messaging  that  explains  the  purpose  and  functions  of  
civilian oversight in an accessible and engaging manner across various media formats.  
The   communication   channels   to   reach   target   audiences   include   print,   video,  
community  newsletters,  social  media,  and  in-person  communications,  all  of  which  
should reflect the office's brand.   
   
We will create a brand toolkit for the OCPO to use in its outreach efforts. This toolkit  
will include social media  messaging templates and a social media campaign strategy  
aligned  with  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  for  various  platforms  to  measure  
engagement  effectively. A  Constant  Contact©  email  marketing  strategy  will  also  be  
developed to ensure consistent communication with key stakeholders and facilitate  
press releases.   
   
Strategy 3: Outreach and Engagement   
  
Establish fifteen outreach zones, each corresponding to one of the City of Dallas's 15  
Council  Districts.  This  initiative  aims  to  create  an  inclusive  outreach  plan  that  
addresses the needs of all community members, especially those from marginalized  
or  underserved  communities.  It  will  also  provide  opportunities  for residents  to  give  
feedback, share their concerns, and participate in the oversight process.    
   
Effective civilian oversight relies heavily on community involvement.  Gathering input  
from  the  community  and  stakeholders  is  essential  to  shaping  civilian  oversight.  

                                                                                                                 Page 4 of 12   
   
   
  

----------------------- Page 98-----------------------

  

Understanding  how  it  should  operate  and  which  accountability  issues  to  address  
ensures the development of a tailored system that meets the community’s needs and  
expectations. Active participation from those most affected by local law enforcement  
issues is essential for civilian oversight to achieve its goals.   
   
To facilitate this process, we will maintain a dedicated 24/7 hotline and organize regular  
community meetings.   
   
Strategy 4: Promote Transparency and Accountability  
  
Increase conversion rates by strategically engaging the community, businesses, and  
organizations. This can be achieved by sharing information about the civilian oversight  
process, including investigations, complaint data, and recommendations. We aim to  
encourage measurable engagement through targeted messaging and clear calls to  
action. To further enhance transparency, we will publish detailed reports, host public  
hearings, and provide regular updates on the oversight body's activities. This approach  
ensures continuous accountability and informed participation.   
  
To measure public input, we will utilize the following methods :    

     •    Public comment at meetings,   
     •    Responses via email and social media   
     •    Community Feedback from Complaint and Commendation Form Submissions   
     •    Calls received on a dedicated 24/7 hotline.

Assessment of Outreach and Engagement   
   
Community engagement is essential for building trusting relationships between citizens  
and law enforcement. It is important to understand the community’s perception of law  
enforcement, identify areas of concern, and pinpoint specific needs related to police  
accountability and transparency.   
   
The   outreach   team  will   track   and   report   on   engagement   activities   using   key  
performance indicators, such as the number of participants at events. They will conduct  
surveys, focus groups, public meetings, and community forums. Additionally, the team  
will  maintain  an  engagement  calendar  to  document  events,  facilitate  community  
educational  presentations,  and  collect  stakeholder  feedback.  We  will  also  gather  
measurable input from communities within these outreach zones, including reports of  
officer misconduct and commendations, to ensure effective oversight and continuous  
improvement.  To  facilitate tracking of community engagement across the 15 council  
districts, we will utilize dynamic QR codes printed on outreach materials. Our outreach  
methods will include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:   
   
      •    Conducting community meetings and providing educational presentations.  
      •    Connecting with local leaders and community-based organizations.   
      •    Making policy recommendations based on community feedback and complaint  
           data and providing district partners with marketing materials.   
      •    Facilitating efforts that align with the office's mission within the outreach zones.   
   
Timeline for Implementation  
    
The activities outlined in this Community Outreach and Engagement Plan will be  
aligned with a proposed outreach schedule, ensuring a structured and timely  
approach to implementation.   
  
Phase 1 – Production/Awareness   
  
A  key  component  of  the  outreach  activities  involves  the  creation  of  informative  
materials for distribution and marketing.  Staff will develop materials for the OCPO to  
share with community-based organizations (CBO) and other resources to inform the  
public about the OCPO. Another aspect of this phase includes the introduction of the  
Director of  OCPO  to communities,  the  rollout  of  a new OCPO  webpage,  videos, a  
social media presence, and a media campaign.

Phase 2 - Educational Outreach   
  
This phase encompasses the OCPO’s educational campaign to inform  City of Dallas  
residents about the office’s role, the complaint process, opportunities for community  
participation, and the tools available for submitting input and feedback. The goal in this  
phase  is  to  reach  out  to  all  communities,  businesses,  and  organizations  while  
specifically targeting those communities that are traditionally difficult to engage or have  
not  been  invited  to  engage  in  the  process.  Additionally,  the  office  will  initiate  a  
partnership  with  the  DPD Academy  to  raise  awareness  of  the  OCPO  and  CPOB  
functions through presentations.   
  
The  OCPO  will  collaborate  with  statewide  and  local  non-profit  organizations  and  
businesses to form strategic partnerships to advance  this educational  initiative. This  
initiative will launch in March, along with the rollout of targeted social media campaigns,  
intended to inform City of Dallas residents of the process and encourage participation  
in  Phase 3. The OCPO will host educational meetings across the 15 Outreach Zones  
the  office  defines.  The  office  is  also  dedicated  to  engaging  diverse  communities,  
ensuring accessibility for non-English-speaking populations.  Outreach print collateral  
will be available in the languages that align with the top 7 common languages in the  
City of Dallas.   
  
Phase 3 - Public Meetings for Public Input (CBO Input)   
  
In this phase, the Office of Community Police Oversight (OCPO) will focus on gathering  
public input through community forums scheduled throughout the city. The OCPO will  
collaborate with community-based organizations (CBOs) to promote these events and  
facilitate feedback sessions. The OCPO and/or the community groups involved will  
lead these public forums.   
  
During  this  phase,  a  "soundboard"  will  be  used  to  consider  public  input  for  both  
operational improvements and trust-building efforts. The office will also employ tools  
                                                                                                                Page 11 of 12

such as surveys and open discussions, referred to as communities of interest (COI),  
to collect feedback from the public. By the conclusion of this phase, we will have our  
first  set  of  metrics  data  available. The  primary  goal  of  this  phase  is  to  enhance  
transparency and empower the public by providing access to the resources offered by  
the Office of Community Police Oversight.
