                                External Complaint Workflow 
          No Investigation Sub-Classification General Definitions 

  It is the policy of the Department to accept and investigate all complaints of misconduct or 
  wrongdoing from any citizen as prescribed by state law and Department policy.  Complaints are 
  handled in accordance with Texas Government Code, Section 614 021-614.023, as interpreted 
  by the City Attorney. 

  A No Investigation (NI) number is assigned to information received in the Internal Affairs 
  Division that does not meet the guidelines of a complaint requiring a full investigation by the 
  Department. The information is given a sub-classification for statistical tracking purposes.  The 
  current sub-classifications used are 

  .   Does not meet criteria- Complaints relative to differences of opinion between a citizen and 
     the investigating officer regarding the contributing factors listed on an accident report will 
     not be investigated. lf a person calls or comes in but does not want to provide a written 
     statement at that time,  it will be entered.  If they fail to follow up and provide a written 
     complaint In any format,  it may result in this sub-classification. 

 •   Duplicate Complaint- Person is making a repeated allegation that has already been 
     handled by the department. 

 •   Fail to Articulate- Person may be complaining but does not make an allegation of 
     misconduct. 

 •   Guilt or innocence- 
         •  Complaints relative to differences of opinion between a citizen and an arresting 
            police officer regarding the guilt or innocence of that citizen will not be investigated 
            but will be properly disposed of within the judicial system.     If a citizen can furnish 
            evidence that the arrest was malicious and/or illegal, the complaint may be 
            investigated at the discretion of the Internal Affairs Division Commander. 
        •   Complaints relative to differences of opinion between a police officer and a citizen 
            over the issuance of a traffic citation will not be investigated unless there is an 
            allegation of a violation of law or departmental rules on the part of the officer. 

•   Information Only-A person may just be sending information or needing something from a 
    member of the department. For instance, needing a detective to call them back about a 
    case. A complaint about having to wait a long time for a police response to a911 call may 
    receive this sub-classification.   Information is forwarded to division of responsibility. 

•   More information- Person makes an allegation of misconduct, but the department needs 
    more information to make determination on how to proceed. 

----------------------- Page 18-----------------------

      No Violation- Preliminary investigation is able to determine,  based on evidence available, 
     there is no violation of department procedures. Complaints involving a citizen's 
     misunderstanding of departmental policy,  which are resolved by a supervisor explaining the 
     correct departmental policy and where the citizen is satisfied with the response, will not 
     require investigation. 

     No Violation BWC- Preliminary investigation is able to determine there is no violation due 
     to review of officer's body worn camera. 

     Non-Employee- Person makes allegation into misconduct of person who is not an 
     employee of the police department. 

     Sixty Day- Complaints are not typically accepted more than sixty days after the alleged 
     incident, with the following exceptions. 
             When the complaint involves a criminal violation, the criminal statute of limitations 
             will prevail. 
         •   When the complainant can show good cause for not making the complaint within the 
             specified time limit. 

•   Third Party- Person complaining has no direct knowledge of incident. Otten used when 
    person sends an email or letter after seeing a negative news or social media story. 

In all case,  the citizen is sent a return letter to inform them that the information or complaint 
has been received and how it will be handled. If the department is not going to investigate, the 
reason is given with contact information on who they may call to discuss.
