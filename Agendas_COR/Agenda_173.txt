Metrics & Trends  
  

  
   •   Across the country, classical music saw a surge of listening  
      during the pandemic. That surge has ended.  

   •   With more breaking news and the election season,  people  
      are tuning in more to news.  

   •   WRR is affected by Nielsen Ratings panel selection and a lack  
      of incoming panelists listening  to WRR.  

   •   WRR has seen a 9,700 Weekly Cume drop from Nielsen  
      Audience panels alone.  WRR has no control over the  
      panelists chosen by Nielsen.  

                                                                                                      44

              To combat the recent ratings dip and to  
       continue to build WRR into a best-in-class  
classical station that feels more local than ever,  
                                     KERA is doing the following:

SUBJECT   Black Dance Theatre Updated Funding Allocation for the FY 2024-25 Cultural  
         Organizations Program  
  
         On  December  11,  2024,  City  Council  will  consider  the  updated  funding  allocation  
         recommendation  for  Dallas  Black  Dance  Theatre,  Incorporated  (DBDT)  for  the  Fiscal  
         Year 2024-25 Cultural Organizations Program (COP) contract in an amount not to exceed  
         $248,435.00. The Cultural Organizations Program contracts with cultural organizations  
         with budgets ranging from $100,000 to over $10 million to provide an annual season of  
         programming for residents and visitors of Dallas.  
  
         On October 21,  2024,  the Quality  of Life,  Arts  &  Culture  Committee  (QOLAC) of  City  
         Council  considered  the  funding  allocation  recommendation  for  Dallas  Black  Dance  
         Theatre along with 55 other Dallas-based nonprofit arts and cultural organizations through  
         the FY 2024-25 Cultural Organizations Program.  
  
         QOLAC took into consideration the allegations of unfair labor practices levied against  
         DBDT by the American Guild of Musical Artists (AGMA), the labor union which represents  
         the  dancers  who  were  recently  terminated  by  DBDT  in  August.  As  a  result,  QOLAC  
         recommended to City Council that the proposed funding allocations for consideration be  
         recommended with the amendment, “to remand the funding allocation for Dallas Black  
         Dance Theatre to the Arts and Culture Advisory Commission’s Allocations Committee for  
         reconsideration   and   referral   back   to   the   Quality   of   Life   Committee   for   further  
         consideration.”  On  October 23,  2024,  City  Council  approved  the  FY  2024-25  Cultural  
         Organizations Program funding allocations as amended.  

  
         As  the  Allocations  Committee  of  the  Arts  and  Culture  Advisory  Commission  met  on  
         November 7, 2024 to reconsider the funding allocation for Dallas Black Dance Theatre  
         (DBDT).  Acknowledging  the  importance  of  Dallas  Black  Dance  Theater  to  the  City  of  
         Dallas and to the communities that it serves, the Allocations Committee recommended  
         that City Council preserve the initial funding recommendation of $248,435 for Dallas Black  
         Dance Theatre pending one of the following outcomes:  
              •    If a ruling is made in DBDT’s favor by the National Labor Review Board (NLRB) on  
                   or before April 15, 2025, the full $248,435 funding recommendation for DBDT be  
                   immediately approved.  

                                                                    “Service First, Now!”  
  
                                                            Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                          67

                  •    If  an  agreement  or settlement  is reached  between  DBDT and  the  NLRB  on  or

                       immediately approved.  
                  •    Alternatively, If DBDT is found to be at fault in the proceedings conducted by the

                       ALANNA programming.  

  
             On November 21, 2024, the Arts and Culture Advisory Commission recommended to the

         City Facilities Partners Update – Dallas Theater Center re: Kalita Humphreys  
SUBJECT  

        Theater  

        On September 16, 2024, the Office of Arts and Culture (OAC) provided to the Quality of  
        Life, Arts and Culture Committee (QOLAC) the memo, “City Facilities Partners Update –  
        Dallas Theater Center,” in which OAC provided historical context and other information  
        relevant to the partnership between the Dallas Theater Center (DTC) and the City. Much  
        of this information was related to the lease and management agreement the City has with  
        DTC to manage operations of the Kalita Humphreys Theater.  
  
        OAC informed QOLAC that the current fifth amendment to the agreement is set to expire  
        June 1, 2025. Understanding the needs of the Kalita, both in operation and facility upkeep,  
        the Committee provided guidance that OAC needs to take a primary and intentional role  
        in addressing facility related operation, maintenance, and capital projects. As such, OAC  
        is leading the process with DTC as a meaningful partner and collaborator to navigate the  
        complex process of creating a successful and sustainable solution to the management of  
        the Kalita.  

        OAC held meetings with DTC through November to discuss the current usage of the Kalita  
        by DTC and other users of the facility. A significant takeaway from our meetings was the  
        issue of booking schedules for DTC and all other users of the facility. Theater companies  
        request dates in advance of up to a year to secure the space for a production. From these  
        meetings and understanding of the needs of the tenants at the Kalita, OAC and DTC have  
        collaborated on a plan of action that will allow the proper consideration for the future of  
        the Kalita’s operation and management as well as provide DTC and other users of the  
        facility with sufficient time to plan for future seasons.  
  
        OAC recommends the execution of a sixth amendment to the current agreement to extend  
        the expiration date through September 30, 2028. This extension will provide a timeline of  
        three standard performance seasons which typically run from September 1 of a given year  
        to the following August 31. Two of these years will allow for OAC to engage with DTC and  
        other partners to address the complexities of the current agreement and determine the  
        best solution for a successful, safe, accessible, and sustainable future operation of the  
        Kalita.  
  
        After the initial two-year period, the third year will allow for the proper communication and  
        planning  for  any  given  outcome  to  ensure  that  theater  groups  do  not  experience  an  
        interruption in their season planning processes.

              OAC also took into account the timeline for the 2024 Bond Program. Currently, the 2024  
              Bond Program addressing repairs and upgrades to the Kalita is scheduled to begin FY  
              2027-28 for planning with construction beginning FY 2028-29. At the beginning of the third  
              year of the proposed extension, which would take place at the beginning of FY 2027- 28,  
              OAC will have a clear understanding of the future operation and management of the Kalita  
              allowing for the most efficient and relevant repairs and upgrades to be made to the facility.  

              OAC is currently drafting the sixth amendment to be reviewed by DTC and subsequently  
              the City Attorney’s Office.  
  
              Please contact me or the Director of Arts and Culture, Martine Elyse Philippe, with any
