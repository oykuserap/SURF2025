                       the Interior’s standards.  
                   7.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to   replace     light  fixtures    over    courtyard-facing  
                       entrances be approved in accordance with materials,  
                       drawings  and  specifications  dated  2/16/24.    The  
                       proposed      work    is   consistent    with    preservation  
                       criterion  Section  3.6;  the  standards  in  City  Code  
                       Section     51A-4.501(g)(6)(c)(ii)     for   noncontributing  
                       structures;    and    the   Secretary     of   the   Interior’s  
                       standards.  
                   8.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to replace light fixture to the side of outward-facing  
                       kitchen  entrances  be  approved  in  accordance  with

                       Section     51A-4.501(g)(6)(c)(ii)     for   noncontributing  
                       structures;    and    the   Secretary     of   the   Interior’s  
                       standards.  
                   Task Force Recommendation:  
                   1.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to replace non-historic railings on faux “balconies” be  
                       approved with conditions.  
                   2.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to replace all courtyard-facing non-historic doors with  
                       fiberglass doors be approved with conditions.  The  
                       doors  should  not  be  Craftsman  style.    Consider  
                       flipping courtyard and outer doors (before applicant  
                       decided to retain existing outer doors).  
                   3.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to  replace  all  windows  (non-historic)  with  1-over-1  
                       vinyl  windows  in  “beige”  color  be  approved  with  
                       conditions.  Consider aluminum windows instead of  
                       vinyl.  
                   4.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to remove all shutters be approved with conditions.   
                       Shutters are not necessary.  
                   5.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to  paint  the  nonmasonry  elements  of  the  building  
                       (Balconies,   Trim   and  Doors:   SW2829   “Classical  
                       White”;    Accent:     SW7048      “Urbane      Bronze”)    be  
                       approved with conditions.  Brown or earth tone colors  
                       would be better than white.  
                   6.   That the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness  
                       to replace railings at front waterfall steps be approved  
                       with conditions.  Steel tube rails instead of wood.
