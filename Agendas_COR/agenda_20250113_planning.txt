SUBJECT  Assistance Programs and Upcoming Agenda Item from OCCE and Office  
         of Procurement Services  
           
           
         For fiscal year 2025 as part of the budget process, the Office of Community Care was  
         reimagined as the Office of Community Care and Empowerment. In this restructuring,  
         OCCE  established  a  Financial  Empowerment  Division  by  aligning  several  existing  
         programs,  including  tax  assistance  programming,  re-entry  services  and  digital  equity  
         programming, anchored in financial empowerment centers (FECs). This memo will focus  
         on our tax assistance program and provide a brief update on FEC future planning. This  
         information  also  ties  into  future  council  agenda  items  from  the  Office  of  Procurement  
         Services related to these programs.     
           
         In an upcoming City Council meeting, City Council will consider the following item:  
           
              1.  Agenda #TBA – Authorize a one-year service contract in the amount of $200,000,  
                   with a one-year renewal option for a total amount of $400,000. The following Office  
                   of Procurement Service item will support the administration of free tax preparation  
                   services for City residents that are low-to-moderate income individuals, persons  
                   with  disabilities,  the  elderly,  and  limited  English  speakers,  for  the  Office  of  
                   Community  Care  –  Foundations  Communities,  only  proposer  -  Not  to  exceed  
                   $400,000 - Financing: General Fund (subject to annual appropriations)  
           
         Tax Assistance Background  
           
         For nearly 10 years, the City of Dallas has partnered with community-based nonprofit  
         providers to promote access to free tax preparation services for low-income residents.  
         These  services  are  provided  primarily  through  local  implementation  of  the  Volunteer  
         Income  Tax  Assistance  (VITA)  program,  an  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  initiative  
         designed  to  assist  low-to-moderate  income  individuals  and  families,  persons  with  
         disabilities, the elderly, and limited English speakers file their taxes each year, ensuring  
         they can file their taxes accurately and access eligible tax credits. With significant financial  
         implications, such as potential refunds from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and  
         Child Tax Credit (CTC), the VITA program plays a crucial role in  promoting household  
         financial  stability,  asset  building  and  consumer  protection  issues  surrounding  tax  
         preparation.  
         In 2024, the availability of this service enabled significant financial and community impact.  
           

                                                                   “Service First, Now!”  
                                                           Connect – Collaborate – Communicate                                                        51

          The VITA program is a foundational financial empowerment program within the Office of  
          Community Care & Empowerment under the Financial Empowerment Division. It not only  
          supports individuals in managing their annual tax responsibilities but will also contribute to  
          broader goals of financial resilience and empowerment. By ensuring individuals claim all  
          eligible credits, the VITA program can significantly increase household income through tax  
          refunds.  This  influx  can  lead  to  improved  financial  health  and  security,  supporting  our  
          mission of financial empowerment. The EITC for low- and moderate-income workers has  
          been  shown  to  increase  work,  reduce  poverty,  lower  welfare  receipt,  and  improve  
          children’s educational attainment.   
            
          The VITA program is also integral in helping individuals access individualized supportive  
          financial empowerment services like financial counseling or financial literacy that support  
          residents on topics such as budgeting, savings, debt management and credit management  
          through direct referrals to the Dallas Financial Empowerment Center.   
             
          Accessibility to the VITA program is important to assist residents to  access knowledge  
          and/or  resources  to  navigate  the  tax  system  effectively.  Each  year,  hundreds  of  IRS  
          certified  volunteers  offer  their  time  and  expertise  at  VITA  sites  across  the  city  to  help  
          thousands of City residents file taxes free of charge. VITA preparers are held to a higher  
          standard of certification than non-regulated preparers. Additionally, with the support of the  
          Dallas  Public  Library,  a  small  volunteer  group  of  AARP  TAX-Aides  provide  free  tax  
          preparation  services  in  areas  where  VITA  services  are  not  available,  which  creates  a  
          robust ecosystem of free tax preparation services for Dallas residents.   
             
           The goal of this program is to serve 15,000 residents. All VITA services will be provided  
           in seven community locations, each of which is accessible via public transit.

          empowerment initiatives. By equipping individuals with equitable tools and resources the  
          VITA program encourages long-term financial stability and resilience, reducing reliance on  
          social services in the future.  
            
          The ongoing support, establishment and promotion of the VITA program fulfills the City’s

            On January 22, 2025 City Council will consider the following item:  
             
                        Agenda Item #25 – 143A Authorize the rejection of the seven proposals received

                        Center program for the Office of Community Care & Empowerment – Financing:  
                        No Cost consideration   
                          
            Financial Empowerment, specifically financial coaching through the FECs, is a foundation  
            of our empowerment portfolio. In March 2024, the City issued an RFP for this service,  
            seeking one or more partners to administer 2-4 FEC sites. From September to November,  
            the City entered negotiations with two selected providers to enter contracts. In December,  
            City leadership recommended the cancellation of the pending solicitation to enable the  
            department in order to make programmatic adjustments to better align with the City’s  
            fiscal realities and that could be sustained in future years.   
             
            Though we are cancelling the current solicitation, OCCE is committed to ensuring the  
            continued  availability  of  FECs.  This  action  serves  to  reduce  current  and  future  years  
            program obligation on the City’s general fund to be more consistent with financial realities.  
            OCCE is working on a long-term funding strategy for the program. In the coming weeks,  
            OCCE will release a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) to identify a program partner

           for  this  work  utilizing  available  grant  funding,  which  will  ensure  the  programming  
           continues once the current program agreements terminate.  
             
           Financial Empowerment Centers Background  
           Dallas Financial Empowerment Center (FEC) provides City residents with one-on-  one  
           financial counseling services as a free public service. Since the launch of the Dallas FEC  
           on  March  2023  to  December  31,  2024  -  1,221  residents  were  served  through  3,694  
           counseling sessions and an additional 567 were served through our telephone financial  
           navigation.   
             
           Key outcomes achieved by participating residents include:  
                •   Total  Increased  Savings  of  $317,889:  This  amount  represents  a  substantial  
                    boost in financial security for participants. Increased savings empower residents  
                    to cover unexpected expenses, invest in their education or businesses, and build  
                    a safety net for the future.  
                •   Reduction  in  Non-Mortgage  Debt  by  $547,773:  Reducing  debt  alleviates  
                    financial stress, enabling participants to allocate their income towards essential  
                    needs such as healthcare, education, and housing. It also allows them to reallocate  
                    funds  towards  savings  or  investments,  ultimately  fostering  long-term  financial  
                    health.  
                •   Increased Credit Scores: 75 participants saw an average increase of 35 points  
                    or established credit for the first time. The improvement in credit scores for 75  
                    participants means better access to affordable loans and mortgages. Higher credit  
                    scores can result in lower interest rates, which can save individuals thousands of  
                    dollars over time, making homeownership more achievable and reducing the cost  
                    of credit.  
                •   Access to Banking : 157 participants opened a safe and affordable bank account.  
                    By assisting participants in opening bank accounts, the FEC has enabled them to  
                    access essential financial services. This not only provides a safe place for their  
                    money but also helps individuals avoid costly check cashing services.   
             
           These accomplishments highlight the vital role the FEC plays in fostering financial stability  
           among Dallas residents. These outcomes reflect the FEC’s commitment to empowering  
           residents with the financial knowledge and tools needed to achieve long-term stability and  
           success. By participating in the FEC's counseling services, residents are taking critical  
           steps toward a more secure financial future, breaking the cycle of debt, and fostering  
           economic growth within the community.  
             
           The  new NOFA  will  be  developed promptly  to ensure  continuation  of  services  and to  
           secure the best possible contract for our organization and its residents.
