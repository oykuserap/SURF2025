It also highlighted the possibility of deliberating on personnel matters and security assessments, which are critical for maintaining the city's operational integrity and safety.\n\n**Action Items**:  \nNo decisions or approvals were sought during this meeting due to its cancellation. However, the agenda suggested that if the meeting had proceeded, the TRL would have potentially addressed significant legal, financial, and operational matters requiring council input or approval. \n\nOverall, the meeting was intended to cover important governance issues affecting the Trinity River Corridor but did not take place as scheduled.",

The primary purpose is to discuss housing development options and potential regulatory changes.\n\n**Key Agenda Items**:  \nThe main focus of the meeting will be a briefing on expanding housing development options, specifically concerning regulations for two-to-four-unit housing and minimum residential lot sizes. This discussion will be led by Andrea Gilles, Director, and Andreea Udrea, Assistant Director of Planning & Urban Design.\n\n**Important Details**:  \nThe proposed changes aim to enhance housing availability and affordability in Dallas by potentially adjusting zoning regulations that currently limit the development of smaller residential units.

While no formal decisions are expected to be made during this meeting, the outcomes will inform future recommendations to the City Council regarding housing policy adjustments. \n\nThe meeting will be broadcast live, allowing public participation and input on the discussed topics.",
